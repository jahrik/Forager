# Motion Part 3: code and tests written, nothing compiled yet

Dispatch 2026-09-28-676 (RECORD intent -676; preserved at `prompts/preserved/2026-10-07-13.md` on branch `records-after-173`).
The owner's choices: RECORD -651, with the night-mode note in -652 and "Use it, then prune" in -655. The scout:
`docs/ui/2026-10-07-motion-scout.md` on branch `motion-scout` (8a40c6d4). Branch `motion-part-3`, cut from `origin/motion-part-2`
at `008ebbab`, the base the dispatch names (the worktree was cut from a fresh fetch, and `git ls-remote` showed the remote at the same commit before any code was written).
Part 2 is not merged; nothing here is on `main`. No PR.

**Status: written, not run.** The dispatch holds Gradle for the planner's go. Nothing on this branch has been compiled, no test
has run, and no revert check has been done. Every claim below about behaviour is what the code is written to do, not something
observed.

Paths are relative to `app/src/main/java/com/zynergylabs/forager/app/ui/` unless they start with `app/` or `docs/`.

## What was built

1. **Journal pages, "Slide in, slide back"** (`motion/PageSlide.kt`). `PageSlide` shows one page at a time: a page at least as
   deep as the current one slides in from the right **over** it, the page beneath staying still; a shallower one is uncovered by
   the current page sliding out to the right, the page beneath in place from the first frame (Back retraces the way in). A
   leaving page takes no touch (Part 1's `leavingTakesNoTouches`), keeps only its leaving marker in the semantics tree (Part 2's
   fix (a)), and has its Back handlers off (Part 2's inert Back owners, now `internal` in `motion/TabCrossfade.kt` and shared).
   Pages with the same key update in place, so typing in an editor never slides. Each page carries what it shows (the open
   find or entry), so a report sliding out after its find has closed still draws. `SlideOverPage` is the same for a page that
   comes in over content that stays composed beneath it. Applied to:
   - **J1, J2**: Entries | Records (`log/JournalTab.kt`). Records slides in over Entries from the switch; Back or the switch slides
     it out to the right.
   - **F1, F2**: the Finds pages (`log/JournalTab.kt`, new `FindsPage`): gallery, report, editor, location picker, From Album.
   - **F3**: the find opened over the view from a map bubble slides in over the view and out again (`SlideOverPage`). While it
     comes in, nothing beneath takes a touch over the whole area (it swallowed every touch before); while it goes, it takes
     none. As it goes it keeps drawing the page it last showed, not the gallery.
   - **J3, J4**: Entries' home, the drafts list, an entry's report and editor, and the spinner before a new entry's editor
     (`log/CartographyScreen.kt`, new `EntriesPage`). The early returns became pages; each branch's Back handler moved into its
     page, so it is composed only while that page shows, as before.
   - **J7**: the editor's "+ Add a photo from the Album" picker is now `CartographyScreen`'s own page, sliding in over the editor.
     Its flag is held by `CartographyScreen` and passed to `CartographyEntryEditScreen` (`pullingPhotoState`, `drawsPhotoPicker =
     false`); the editor on its own keeps its old behaviour by default.
2. **Lists, "Slide and close up"** (`motion/ListMotion.kt`). `rememberListRows` keeps a row that has gone missing where it was,
   marked as leaving, until `ListRowMotion` has faded and shrunk it; the rows below close up as its height goes. If it comes back
   while leaving (Undo), it is the same row turned round. A new row fades and grows in. A lazy list adds `animateItem`'s
   placement glide so a moved row glides to its place. Nothing animates on a list's first rows (opening, or loading into an empty
   screen) or after its `resetKey` changes. A leaving row takes no touch and leaves the semantics tree. Applied to:
   - Entries (J9; `log/CartographyEntryListScreen.kt`, so the drafts list too, which uses it), month headers kept with their rows;
   - Finds tiles (F6; `log/FindsGalleryScreen.kt`), shrinking in place as tiles; switching Log and Drafts is a `resetKey`, so
     it stays instant;
   - Records: the All logbook's timed rows, and a whole day when its last record goes (R4; `log/RecordsLogbookList.kt`), and the
     Tracks list (`track/TrackExportPanel.kt`);
   - waypoints (P2; `availability/AvailabilityTripsWaypointsUi.kt`) and regions (R15; `availability/AvailabilityOfflineMapsUi.kt`);
   - the List tab's results (L4; `availability/AvailabilityResultsUi.kt`).
   Swipe rows are wrapped, not changed: their drag, snap and actions are as before.
3. **Words, "Numbers instant, words fade"**: the Records logbook's day header ("· 1 record" / "· 2 records", R7) through Part 2's
   `WordSwap`. Every other word item is a stop (below).
4. **Night mode, "Fade the colours", fast and smooth** (`theme/ColorSchemeFade.kt`, wired in `theme/Theme.kt`). Every role of the
   colour scheme blends from light to dark or back on the motion scheme's fast effects spring, about a tenth of a second
   (critically damped, stiffness 3800; worked out, not measured). At rest the app is drawn with `LightColors` or `DarkColors`
   themselves. Instant under reduced motion.
5. **Prune** (owner, RECORD -655: "Use it, then prune"), with no production caller after this part, checked by `git grep`
   across the tree:
   - from `motion/MotionTokens.kt`: `markerEntranceSpec`, `MARKER_CLUSTER_STAGGER_STEP_MS`, `selectionPulseSpec`,
     `SELECTION_PULSE_MIN_SCALE`, `SELECTION_PULSE_MAX_SCALE`, `narrativeRevealSpec`, `ROUTE_REVEAL_MS_PER_KM`,
     `routeRecalculationMorphSpec`, `dataLayerOverlaySpec`;
   - `motion/MotionPrecedence.kt` entire (precedence order, degradation tiers, `activeTiers`, the 12-object budget, the clustering
     threshold), with `app/src/test/.../motion/MotionPrecedenceTest.kt`.
   Kept, because something calls them: `feedbackMotionSpec`, `PRESS_BOUNCE_SCALE`, `iconSwapSpec`, `ICON_SWAP_ENTER_SCALE`,
   `panelMotionSpec`, `navigationMotionSpec`, `tabCrossfadeSpec`, `mapPopUpFadeSpec`, `mapPopUpGrowSpec`, `MAP_POPUP_ENTER_SCALE`,
   `navigationViewChromeSpec`, `wordSwapSpec`, `LOCATION_INDICATOR_MOVE_DURATION_MS` (`map/SightingsMap.kt:1730`), and the three new
   ones. `docs/motion-spec.md` marks each removed name where it was cited, with the rule text left as written, and ADR-0002 gains a
   dated amendment rather than an edited table.
   **Found, not pruned (outside the dispatch's two files):** `MotionTreatment`, `ReducedMotionTreatment` and
   `reducedMotionEquivalent` in `motion/ReduceMotion.kt` have no production caller either.

New tokens: `pageSlideSpec` and `listRowSpec` (`defaultEffectsSpec`), and `nightModeFadeSpec(scheme)` (`fastEffectsSpec`, read from
the scheme the theme provides, since it fades the theme's own colours). No `tween` or `spring` at a call site. `docs/motion-spec.md`
§2 and §4 gain the rows; ADR-0002 gains the amendment with the reason the two moving categories sit on a critically damped spec.

## Verified before building, and how

By reading this branch at `008ebbab` unless said otherwise.

- The base: a fresh fetch of `origin/motion-part-2` gave `008ebbab`, and `git ls-remote` agreed before any code was written.
- The helpers the dispatch names exist: `leavingTakesNoTouches` (`motion/LeavingTakesNoTouches.kt`), `WordSwap`
  (`motion/WordSwap.kt`), `clickableWithShapedPress` (`motion/PressFeedback.kt:138`), `BouncingIconButton`
  (`motion/BouncingIconButton.kt:21`), and fix (a) (`motion/TabCrossfade.kt`, `clearAndSetSemantics` on the leaving tab).
- `MotionTokens.kt` had no raw `tween`/`spring` but Part 2's one exception (`navigationViewChromeSpec`), which is untouched.
- Every Journal screen move in the scout was a plain `when` or an early `return` (`log/JournalTab.kt:661`, `:489-586`, `:793-798`;
  `log/CartographyScreen.kt:449-519`; `log/CartographyEntryEditScreen.kt:178-197`), so no screen kept a page composed to slide.
- Each map-hosting page calls the map slot once, and each call is its own `MapView` (Part 2's report; the comment at
  `log/CartographyEntryReportScreen.kt:472-474`). A slide keeps the leaving page composed, so a report with a map sliding out over
  a list keeps one map; Entries with an open entry map sliding under Records on its Offline maps chip holds two for a moment.
- The lists: Entries and Finds are lazy grids with stable keys (`log/CartographyEntryListScreen.kt:147-148` at `008ebbab`,
  `log/FindsGalleryScreen.kt:136`, `:140`), the List tab a keyed `LazyColumn`, and Records, Tracks, waypoints and regions plain
  `Column`s keyed with `key(...)`.
- Material 3's colour scheme: `ColorScheme` in material3 1.5.0-alpha26 is immutable (48 `final long` fields) and provided through
  `staticCompositionLocalOf` (both read from the jar's bytecode with `javap` in this session). Hence a whole-tree recomposition
  per frame of the night fade.
- `ExitTransition.KeepUntilTransitionsFinished` is `internal` in animation 1.12.1 (bytecode, `$animation` suffix), so the covered
  page uses `ExitTransition.None` and relies on AnimatedContent keeping it until the slide-in ends (unverified; see below).
- The remaining production callers of every token, by `git grep` over `app/src/main`, before and after the prune.

## Premises that were wrong or incomplete

- **"Use Part 2's `WordSwap`" for status lines and labels.** Most of the scout's word items sit in or above something tappable.
  `WordSwap` holds the larger of the two lines for the length of its crossfade, so a button whose label changes (F9), a row whose
  height changes (R16, R18), or a button beside a label that changes length (J15's Continue) would hold its old touch area or
  place for that moment. That is a touch-area change, which the dispatch makes a stop; Part 2 left the coordinates' swap (C5)
  instant for the same reason. Only R7 moves nothing.
- **"Prune MotionTokens.kt and MotionPrecedence."** `motion/ReduceMotion.kt` holds three more unused declarations
  (`MotionTreatment` and friends), outside the two files named; reported, not removed.
- **The scout's R4** says the Records lists are plain columns, so the lazy item animation is not available. True; the leaving
  rows are kept by `rememberListRows` instead, which works in both. The consequence: a row that **moves** in a plain column (not
  added, not removed) still jumps. Records, Tracks, waypoints and regions are sorted by time, so this is only seen if a record's
  time changes.
- **The scout's J9** includes the Entries album grid. The album is photos, not entries; not built, listed as a stop.

## Stops for the owner (not decided here)

1. **An arriving page takes touches where it is drawn.** The slide moves a page by placement, not by drawing alone, because two
   Journal pages host a live map, and a hosted `View` follows placement. So for the length of a slide-in, the arriving page's
   controls are where they are drawn, on their way. Settled touch areas are unchanged. The alternative (touches held at the
   settled place, as Part 2's pop-ups do) would leave a map page's map drawn at its settled place while the rest of the page
   slides. Keep, or ask for another way?
2. **Short landscape window: the L1 row slides with each page.** The row holding the Entries | Records switch is drawn inside
   each page (`CartographyScreen`'s `ShortWindowFrame`, Records' column), so in a short window it slides in and out with the
   page, switch included. Keep, or hoist the row above the slide (a structural change to both screens)?
3. **Word items left instant** because a crossfade would move a touch area: F9 (Add Location / Change Location button), J15
   (drafts banner label beside Continue), R16 (a region's Not downloaded / Stale lines inside its tappable row), R18 (No location
   picked yet / Download region, above the slider and buttons). Leave instant, or crossfade and accept the moment?
4. **Word items left instant for other reasons**: Q7 (the search summary is the search field's placeholder; the field's slot is
   one of the scout's deliberately instant items); T6 (the folder name appears, it is not a swap); P4 ("Today" appears, not a
   swap); T8 (the restore caption).
5. **Screen moves not clearly covered by "Journal pages"**, left instant: J5 (timeline / album toggle), J6, J10, F5, F8 (spinner,
   empty and content swaps), E1 (the entry map going fullscreen: a size animation of a live map), E2 and E3 (the entry map and
   offline row arriving late), R1 (the filter chips' list swap), F4 (Log / Drafts), R11 and R12 (one bottom sheet replacing
   another), T1 to T3 (the Tools drawer's pages: "Journal pages" names the Journal), K1 (the camera, a full-screen dialog), V1
   to V5 (the photo viewer, a dialog window).
6. **R2**: a find tapped in the All logbook selects the Finds chip and opens its report together. The chip change is R1 (not
   covered), so the report appears at once on the way in; Back from it slides it out over the Finds gallery. Slide it in too?
7. **Lists not built**: the Entries album grid (J9's album half), find pairs re-pairing in the logbook (R5), the trip planner's
   cards (P1), the find editor's photo row (F7). Which, if any?
8. **Reduced motion** (my calls, under §4's "fade or instant"): pages change at once with no leaving page kept; list rows come
   and go at once; night mode changes at once. The alternative for each is a plain fade.

## Decided beyond the dispatch's words (my calls, open to reversal)

- **Slides and list motion on a critically damped spring** (`defaultEffectsSpec`), not a spatial one: an expressive spatial
  spring overshoots, which on a slide-in bares a strip of the page beneath at the right edge, and on a list bounces every row
  below. Recorded in ADR-0002's amendment with the alternative.
- **Depth decides direction.** Records is "in from" Entries (it is the side Back leaves); a find's pages go gallery, report,
  editor, pickers; Entries' go home, drafts list, report, editor, album picker. Save from an editor back to its report slides the
  editor out, as Back would.
- **The spinner before a new entry's editor and the editor are one page**, so the editor replaces its spinner in place instead of
  sliding twice.
- **Grid tiles** (Finds, Entries in two columns) shrink in place and the grid closes up after them with a glide, rather than
  shrinking in height, which in a grid would leave the row's other tile standing at full height.
- **Night mode**: things that pick their colour from whether night mode is on, not from the scheme (`LocalForagerDarkTheme`: parts
  of the map chrome), the system bars' icons, and the map's basemap reload (G2) all change at the start, as before.

## Overlap with other branches

`data-a-entry` (data part A, unmerged) changes `log/CartographyScreen.kt` (13 lines, inside the entry detail this part turned into
a page), `log/CartographyEntryEditScreen.kt` (235 lines) and `log/JournalTab.kt` (8 lines). This branch's edits to those files were
kept small where they meet (the entry detail keeps its body and names; the editor gains two parameters and three changed lines),
but the second of the two to merge main will have conflicts to resolve by hand. `git diff origin/motion-part-2...origin/data-a-entry`
was read for this; nothing was merged.

## Tests written (none run)

Under `app/src/test/java/com/zynergylabs/forager/app/ui/`. Every touch is a real coordinate touch; every mid-animation read is
with the clock stopped and the state write applied before frames are stepped.

- `log/JournalPageSlideTest.kt`, through the real `JournalTab` under `ForagerTheme`:
  - a find's report slides in over the gallery; mid-slide a real touch on the gallery's "+" tile, still drawn and not yet covered,
    starts no new find;
  - Back slides the report out to the right with the gallery in place, and a touch on the uncovered tile reaches the gallery;
  - Back, just started: a touch on the leaving report, where it is still drawn, goes through it to the gallery's tile beneath;
  - under reduced motion the report replaces the gallery at once;
  - Records slides in over Entries from the switch, and Back slides it out with Entries in place at the left edge;
  - a find opened over the view (the real `VIEW_FIND` request) slides in, and a touch on the still-uncovered Records half of the
    switch does nothing;
  - Back slides that find out with the view beneath in place.
- `availability/ListMotionTest.kt`, through `WaypointsSection` and `CartographyEntryListScreen`, deleting by each row's own Delete
  accessibility action: a deleted waypoint shrinks from its own top while the row below is caught between its two places, and a
  touch on what is left of it (first shown to open it when at rest) opens nothing; Undo while leaving grows it back from where it
  had got to; reduced motion removes it at once with the row below in its place; a deleted Entries card in the lazy list takes no
  touch while leaving and the next card closes up into its place.
- `motion/ListRowsMergeTest.kt` (plain JUnit): where a leaving row is kept, two at once, Undo reusing the same state, a new row
  starting hidden, nothing kept when not animating, a reorder keeping each row's state.
- `theme/NightModeFadeTest.kt`, through `ForagerTheme(darkTheme)`: a frame is drawn part-way between light and dark (by luminance,
  since Compose blends in Oklab), it ends exactly on the dark scheme, it is over within half a second of frames, under reduced
  motion only the two ends are ever drawn, and the blend's last listed role moves with the rest.
- `motion/MotionTokensTest.kt`: the pruned categories' tests removed; the three new ones mapped and critically damped.
- Deleted: `motion/MotionPrecedenceTest.kt`, with the code it tested.

**Not covered by a test:** what the find over the view draws as it leaves (its semantics are cleared, so its last page cannot be
read); Entries' pages (J3, J4) and the album picker (J7), which share `PageSlide` with the tested Finds pages but are not driven
separately; the Finds grid, Records logbook, Tracks list, regions and List tab rows (the same `ListRowMotion` as the two tested);
the R7 header's crossfade (`WordSwap` is tested on its own by Part 2).

**Existing tests at risk, untouched:** tests that read the semantics tree in the same frame as a Journal page change, a list
delete, or a night-mode change with the clock stopped (most settle and are unaffected, as in Part 2); tests reading the Records
day header's bounds (its top padding moved from the text to the `WordSwap` box around it); tests that composed
`CartographyEntryEditScreen` inside `CartographyScreen` and expect the album picker inside the editor's node.

**Revert checks planned** (each from a saved copy, the compile log checked for errors before any result is read, only XML newer
than the run read, and the forward file confirmed restored by checksum):
- R1 `LeavingPageFrame` without `leavingTakesNoTouches`: the "+" tile test fails (a new find started) and the leaving-report test
  fails (the touch is taken by the report).
- R2 the forward slide replaced by `EnterTransition.None`: "the report part-way in" is never seen.
- R3 the back slide replaced by `ExitTransition.None`: "Records part-way out" is never seen.
- R4 `SlideOverPage` without its touch blocker: the Records half of the switch is selected.
- R5 `ListRowMotion` without `leavingTakesNoTouches`: "a leaving row opens nothing" fails, in both list tests.
- R6 `rememberListRows` never animating: "the creek row part-way out" is never seen.
- R7 `mergeListRows` giving a returning row a new state: "Undo turns the same row round" fails.
- R8 `fadingColorScheme` returning the target scheme: "some frame part-way" fails.
- R9 its reduced-motion branch removed: "only the two ends were ever drawn" fails.
- R10 `pageSlideTransform`'s reduced-motion branch removed: "nothing sliding in" fails.

## Unverified because nothing has been compiled

Everything, and in particular:
- that it compiles, including `ContentTransform`'s constructor with named arguments, `animateItem` in the grid and list scopes,
  `run { }` in the logbook's `when`, and the shadowed `editingEntry` parameter in `CartographyScreen`'s entry detail;
- that `ExitTransition.None` keeps a covered page composed and drawn until the slide-in ends (my reading of AnimatedContent, not
  its source in this session; the first test reads the covered page mid-slide, so it will show it);
- that `boundsInRoot` of a leaving page's marker reports its slid position (the tests read it);
- that a `LaunchedEffect` (the `VIEW_FIND` request) runs while the clock is stepped frame by frame (the F3 test depends on it);
- that `AnimatedContent` with a matching key updates a page in place (Part 2's `WordSwap` relies on the same and was green).

## Device checks (S22, after the build)

Each Journal slide in portrait and landscape, light and dark: Entries and Records, a find's pages, an entry's report and editor,
the album picker, the find over the view; the entry report's map sliding (whether a `SurfaceView` map follows the slide and is
clipped at the Journal's edge, or draws over the landscape rail); Entries with an open entry map sliding under Records on Offline
maps (two maps for a moment); the short window's L1 row sliding with its page; list deletes and Undo in Entries, Finds, Records,
Tracks, waypoints and regions, and a List tab results update; the night-mode blend from Settings, whether it is quick and smooth
with the whole app recomposing each frame, and whether the map chrome and system bars changing at the start read as a flash; all
of it again with the phone's animations off.

## Amendment 1 (RECORD -681), applied 2026-10-08, also not compiled

The owner, verbatim: "Same rule everywhere (Recommended)" and, for the short window, "Keep it still (Recommended)". The planner's
calls: R2 slides in as well as out; word items beside tappable controls stay instant; an arriving page taking touches where it is
drawn is accepted; reduced motion stays instant; the three `ReduceMotion.kt` declarations are removed. `origin/main` (bc85fd29,
Parts 1 and 2) was merged in first (131f698c, no conflicts). `data-a-entry` was not yet on `main` and is not merged here.

**Built** (171dd53f, then the tests and this section):
- **Pages are opaque.** `PageSlide` draws every page on the screen's background (`pageColor`, default the Scaffold's
  `colorScheme.background`). Found while applying the rule more widely: the Journal's pages draw no background of their own, so
  without this a page sliding in would have shown the one beneath through it. This applies to everything in the first part too.
- **The short window's L1 row stays still.** `JournalTab` draws the row (switch, search, action) above the pages; Entries hands
  up the action for its last slot through a new `shortWindowHeaderAbove` state (`log/CartographyScreen.kt`), remembered per view
  so it changes only when the view does; Records no longer draws the row. Only the page below slides.
- **R1, R2**: a Records chip's list slides in over All, Back (which steps to All) or the All chip slides it out; chip to chip
  slides in. A find tapped in All brings its report in with the Finds list (`log/RecordsTab.kt`). The chip row stays still.
- **J5**: the album slides in over the timeline; Back or the toggle slides it out. The toolbar stays still
  (`log/CartographyScreen.kt`).
- **F4**: Drafts slides in over Log, and Log slides it out; each tab's grid is its own page with its own rows
  (`log/FindsGalleryScreen.kt`; the `resetKey` from the first part is no longer used there).
- **Lists**: the Entries album (`log/EntriesAlbum.kt`, tiles kept with their day header while they leave), planned trips (P1,
  `availability/AvailabilityTripsWaypointsUi.kt`), the find editor's photos (F7, `log/LogEntryDetailScreen.kt`) and the logbook's
  find tiles (R5, `log/RecordsLogbookList.kt`).
- **Pruned**: `MotionTreatment`, `ReducedMotionTreatment` and `reducedMotionEquivalent` from `motion/ReduceMotion.kt`, with the two
  `ReduceMotionTest` tests that exercised only them.

**New stops** (the rule cannot cover these cleanly):
1. **J6, J10, F5, F8, V4, K2**: a spinner, an empty message or an error giving way to content. No page is opened on top and there
   is no Back to retrace, so "slide in from the right" has nothing to mean. Option: a quick crossfade, or leave instant.
2. **E1** (entry map to fullscreen): the map is one `View` that must not be torn down, so fullscreen cannot be a second page; the
   only motion is growing its container, which re-measures the live map every frame and moves its touch area. Leave instant?
3. **E2, E3** (the entry map and the offline row arriving late): content appearing, not a page. Grow in like a list row, or leave?
4. **R11, R12** (one details sheet replacing another): each is its own `ModalBottomSheet` with Material's motion; a slide between
   them needs one sheet holding both pages, which changes the sheet's height (and touch area) mid-change. Leave as is?
5. **T1 to T3** (the Tools drawer's pages): over the Maps tab the drawer is 80% (`AvailabilityScreen.kt`, `drawerContainerColor`).
   An opaque page breaks "nothing fully obstructs the map"; a page at 80% doubles up over the drawer's own 80% (the rule says layered
   fills composite to 0.8, `MapChromeAlphaTest`); a transparent page shows both pages through each other mid-slide. Slide only
   where the drawer is solid (off Maps), or leave instant everywhere?
6. **K1** (the in-app camera): it is its own full-screen window, tied to status-bar hiding and the rotation that stays the
   system's, with two touch-through bugs on record; a leaving camera window cannot let touches through while it slides away.
7. **V1** (the photo viewer opening): also its own window, with the same limit on its way out. **V2** (next and previous) moves
   sideways between photos, not on top; **V3** (double-tap zoom) and **V5** (Save's state) are not pages. Which, if any?
8. **F7 and R5 still jump at the end**: the removed tile fades and shrinks in place, but the find editor's photos (a `FlowRow`) and
   the logbook's find pairs (a plain column) then reflow at once; neither layout has a placement glide. A glide there needs a
   placement animation this app does not have yet.

**Tests written (not run):**
- `log/JournalPageSlideTest.kt` gains two: a Records chip's list slides in over All with the chip row still and slides out on
  Back with All in place; and in a short window (`w823dp-h384dp-land`) the switch does not move while Records slides in, with
  exactly one switch on screen. Before this amendment the switch was inside each page, so both of those reads would fail.
- **Assertions changed in existing tests:** none. **Tests removed:** `ReduceMotionTest`'s two mapping tests, with the code they
  tested. `MotionTokensTest` was already changed in the first part, for the first prune.
- **Not covered by a test:** J5, F4, the album, trips, the find editor's photos and the find pairs (the same `PageSlide` and
  `ListRowMotion` as the tested ones); the opaque page background (no test reads colour mid-slide).
- **Revert checks added to the plan:** R11, the L1 row drawn back inside the pages (`shortWindowHeaderAbove` ignored): the short
  window test fails on "exactly one switch"; R12, the chip lists without their `PageSlide`: "the Waypoints list part-way in" is
  never seen.

**Existing tests now also at risk, untouched:** the short-window Journal tests (`AvailabilityScreenJournalShortWindowTest`), which
may read the L1 row as part of Entries' or Records' content, or read the Entries action in the row before Entries has handed it up
(it arrives one frame after the view changes, after composition).

## Amendment 2 (RECORD -682), applied 2026-10-08, also not compiled

The owner, verbatim, for the Tools drawer: "Push slide from the left (Recommended)". The planner's calls: J6, J10, F5, F8, V4 and
K2 crossfade; E2 and E3 grow in like rows; E1, R11 and R12 stay instant; K1 and V1 to V5 keep the system's window behaviour; F7 and
R5's end reflow jump is accepted for now.

**Built:**
- **T1 to T3, push from the left** (`motion/PageSlide.kt`: `PageSlideStyle.PUSH_FROM_LEFT` and `pagePushTransform`): the opened
  page enters from the drawer's left edge while the current one leaves by the right, both by a full width on one spec, so their
  edges meet and they never overlap; Back reverses it. Applied to Tools to Settings (`availability/AvailabilitySettingsUi.kt`,
  `CompactToolsDrawerContent`), Settings to Crash logs or Diagnostics (`CompactSettingsTab`, a new `SettingsDrawerPage`), and a
  crash's detail (`crash/CrashLogPanel.kt`, drawn from the file it was opened on). The pages draw no fill (`pageColor =
  Color.Transparent`), so the drawer's own stays the single 80% layer over the map. The leaving page takes no touch and keeps only
  its marker in the semantics tree, as every leaving page does. Same on every tab: the drawer is one.
- **Crossfades** (`motion/StateCrossfade.kt`, new token `stateCrossfadeSpec`, fast effects): the Entries list's spinner, empty
  message and list (J10, `log/CartographyEntryListScreen.kt`), the album's spinner, error, empty message and grid (J10,
  `log/EntriesAlbum.kt`), the Finds gallery's spinner (F5), a find report's empty message and report (F8,
  `log/LogEntryReportScreen.kt`), the album picker's empty message and grid (F8, `log/PullPhotoPickerScreen.kt`), the photo
  viewer's spinner, photo and "Couldn't load" (V4), and the camera's opening spinner, viewfinder and unavailable message (K2,
  keyed on which of the three). The one fading out takes no touch and leaves the semantics tree. Instant under reduced motion.
  **J6** is the spinner before a new entry's editor, which the first part made the same page as the editor: it is replaced in
  place, still at once. A crossfade there would mean splitting that page in two, which I did not do (stop below).
- **E2, E3 grow in** (`GrowIn`, `motion/ListMotion.kt`): the entry report's map and its offline-map row open to their height on
  the list spec instead of popping in (`log/CartographyEntryReportScreen.kt`). The map's structure is the same with and without
  fullscreen, so its one call site never moves; `GrowIn` opens by clipping, so the map is measured at full size from its first
  frame (my reading of `expandVertically`, not run). The map goes at once; the offline row closes the same way.
- **F7, R5:** the end reflow jump is noted in the code comments, as accepted.

**New stops:**
1. **J6** (the spinner before a new entry's editor): one page with the editor since the first part, so it is replaced in place
   at once. Crossfading it means giving the spinner its own key inside that page, so the editor fades in over it. Do it?
2. **Overlap with data part A**, grown: `CartographyEntryReportScreen.kt` (E2, E3) is now edited here too, and `data-a-entry`
   changes it by 91 lines. A hand merge is certain when it lands.

**Tests (not run):**
- New `availability/DrawerPushSlideTest.kt`, through the real `AvailabilityScreen`:
  - Settings pushes in while Tools goes out, with their edges meeting mid-slide (the bounds check), and a real touch on the leaving
    Tools page's close row leaves the drawer open on Settings;
  - Back reverses it, edge to edge;
  - under reduced motion the pages change at once.
- **Assertions changed in existing tests:** none.
- **Not covered by a test:** the crossfades and the grow-ins (`StateCrossfade` and `GrowIn` are not driven by a test of their
  own); that the pages draw no fill (no test reads colour; `MapChromeAlphaTest` owns the drawer's fill and is unchanged).
- **Existing tests now also at risk, untouched:** any that read a spinner, empty message or error and the content in the same
  frame they change (`PhotoViewerDecodeTest`, `InAppCameraDialogTest`, `FindsGalleryScreenTest`, the entry report's map tests);
  `AvailabilityScreenSettingsPanelTest`, which reaches Settings and Crash logs by semantic clicks and settles. If
  `AvailabilityScreenJournalShortWindowTest` breaks at the build, it is reported before it is touched (the planner's item 3).
- **Revert checks added to the plan:** R13, `pagePushTransform`'s forward exit replaced by `ExitTransition.None`: "edge to edge"
  fails; R14, `LeavingPageFrame` without `leavingTakesNoTouches` also makes the drawer's close-row test fail (the drawer closes).

## Merge of data part A and J6 (2026-10-08), also not compiled

- **Merge:** `origin/main` at f17b24b5 (PR #194, data part A) merged in. Git resolved every code file on its own; the one conflict
  was `docs/audits/README.md`, two rows added at the same place, resolved by keeping both (data-a-entry's, then this branch's).
  The four shared Journal files were checked by hand after the merge, and no logic was changed on both sides:
  - `log/CartographyScreen.kt`: A's new editor and report parameters (`onSetGroupIncluded`, `openGroups`, `candidates`,
    `openWaypointRowsState`) sit inside the entry detail this branch made a page, reading the page's own entry.
  - `log/CartographyEntryEditScreen.kt`: A's "In this entry" panel and "Leave out" wording, beside this branch's
    `pullingPhotoState` / `drawsPhotoPicker`; the album picker still opens from A's `onAddFromAlbum`.
  - `log/CartographyEntryReportScreen.kt`: A's tiles, profile and waypoint table are in the report body, below the map block that
    grows in (E2); the offline-map row grows in (E3).
  - `log/JournalTab.kt`: A's three new parameters, passed to `CartographyScreen` beside this branch's `shortWindowHeaderAbove`.
- **J6** (the planner: "yes"): the spinner before a new entry's editor now has its own key inside the editor's page, so it
  crossfades into the editor (`StateCrossfade` in `CartographyScreen`'s page content), with no slide between them. Not driven by a
  test.
- The merge is to be repeated right before the build, since data part C may land on main first.

## Build (the planner's Gradle go), 2026-10-08

**Merge first.** `origin/main` at f6fc6c91 (data part C) merged in (1a1e9737). Two conflicts:
- `availability/AvailabilityResultsUi.kt`, imports only: C removed the `Canvas` import with the Seasonal code it moved out, and this
  branch had added the list-motion imports beside it. Resolved by keeping this branch's imports and C's removal. No logic was
  changed on both sides.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: two rows at the same place, both kept.

**How it was run.** Every run under `systemd-run --user --scope -q -p MemoryMax=5G -p MemorySwapMax=0`, Gradle heap 1536m, Kotlin
daemon 2g, Java temp `~/.cache/forager-test-tmp`; no daemon before the first run; free disk checked before each run (3.1 GB at the
start, 2.8 GB at the end; never under 1.5 GB); the Kotlin daemon stopped after every compile and before every test run;
`./gradlew --stop` at the end, and no Gradle or Kotlin daemon process left. No phone or emulator.

**Compile.** Main compiled first time. The tests had 11 errors, all mine: two test names with a colon (not allowed in a JVM method
name) and a missing `DpRect.height` import (a6ad2e43).

**New tests, first run: 46, 5 failures, each a real finding, fixed in 9d2478e2:**
- Three `JournalPageSlideTest` forward cases found no covered page mid-slide: **`ExitTransition.None` drops the covered page at
  once** (the premise marked unverified above was wrong). The covered page is now held by a fade that stays at full and drops
  only after the slide's own settling time, read from the spec (`pageCoverHold`, `snap` with that delay).
- `ListMotionTest`, the lazy list: a touch on a leaving Entries card opened it. A semantics dump (a throwaway diagnostic copy of
  the test, not kept) showed the card 41.7 dp tall at that moment: **Compose widens the hit area of anything under the 48 dp
  minimum touch target, and that "near" hit path runs even past a clipping layer**, so Part 1's `leavingTakesNoTouches` does not
  hold for small leaving things. Fixed for this part's leaving pieces (`NoTouchTargetExpansion`, a zero minimum touch target only
  while leaving: `ListRowMotion`, page frames, `StateCrossfade`). **Not fixed, reported:** Part 1's and Part 2's other uses
  (`MapPopUp`, the search dropdown, the tab crossfade and bar) have the same gap wherever the leaving thing is under 48 dp in
  either direction, a chip for instance.
- `ListMotionTest`, Undo: it read the row inside the animated box, which is measured at full height throughout (the box opens by
  clipping). It now reads the box itself, frame by frame. A critically damped spring keeps its speed when turned, so the row
  shrinks a little further before it grows back; the test now asserts it never restarts from nothing, turns and grows, and is
  caught part-way. **This is a changed assertion in a test this part wrote**, not an existing one.

**New tests, second run: 46 tests, 0 failures** (`JournalPageSlideTest` 9, `ListMotionTest` 4, `ListRowsMergeTest` 6,
`NightModeFadeTest` 4, `DrawerPushSlideTest` 3, `MotionTokensTest` 13, `ReduceMotionTest` 3, `ProvideReduceMotionTest` 4), all XML
fresh from the run.

**Revert checks, 13 runs covering R1 to R14** (R1 and R14 are one edit, checked against both classes). Each run saved the file,
made a one-line edit, compiled, refused to read results on any compile error (none had one), stopped the Kotlin daemon, ran
the classes, read only XML newer than the run, and restored the file from the saved copy, confirmed by checksum. `git status` was
clean afterwards. Every one failed for its own reason:
- R1/R14, page frames without `leavingTakesNoTouches`: the "+" tile test (a new find started), the leaving-report test (the touch
  was taken by the report), and the drawer test (the drawer closed: its page bounds NaN).
- R2, the forward slide removed: "never saw: the report part-way in", and the same for Records, the short window and the chips.
- R3, the back slide removed: "never saw: Records part-way out", "the report part-way out", "the Waypoints list part-way out".
- R4, the find over the view without its touch blocker: the Records half of the switch was selected.
- R5, `ListRowMotion` without `leavingTakesNoTouches`: "a leaving row opens nothing" failed in both list tests (w-creek, e-2).
- R6, rows never kept to leave: "never saw: the creek row part-way out" (three tests).
- R7, a returning row given a new state: "the row that was leaving, reversed, not a new one" (and two more merge tests).
- R8, no colour blend: "some frame was drawn with a background part-way".
- R9, the reduced-motion branch removed: "only the two ends were ever drawn" failed.
- R10, `pageSlideTransform`'s reduced-motion branch removed: "nothing leaving" failed.
- R11, the L1 row drawn inside the pages again: "Expected exactly '1' node but found '2' ... journal-switch".
- R12, the chip lists without their slide: "never saw: the Waypoints list part-way in".
- R13, the push's forward exit removed: "never saw: Tools part-way out to the right".

**Full suite: 522 classes, 4,163 tests, 24 skipped, 4 failures**, all XML fresh from the run. The four are existing tests,
**not touched**:
1. `AvailabilityScreenJournalShortWindowTest`: "L2 on the album the row's photo button..." and "L7 the Journal's switch, Records
   chip and Entries view survive turning...": `AppNotIdleException`, Compose never idle.
2. `JournalShortWindowCardsTest`: "L6 the album grid is 5 columns in a short window": the same.
   **Cause, read from the code (not yet confirmed by a run):** Amendment 1's still L1 row. Entries hands the row its action
   through state written after composition, remembered per view; the album's action is remembered keyed on
   `albumPhotoAcquisition`, but `rememberPhotoAcquisitionLaunchers` builds a new `PhotoAcquisitionLaunchers` (a plain class) on
   every composition. So in album view every composition makes a new action, writes the state, recomposes the Journal, and
   composes Entries again: an endless loop. The timeline's action is remembered with no key, which is why only album cases fail.
   **Proposed fix (mine, in production code, no test change):** remember the album action with no key, reading the launchers
   through `rememberUpdatedState`, as the timeline's already does.
3. `LeavingTheJournalFixesTest`: "F1 a new find left by Back offers Discard...": "could not find any node ... contains 'Draft'".
   A diagnostic copy dumped the tree after its "Drafts (1)" tap: the Drafts tab was not selected, and the search dropdown's scrim
   ('search-dropdown-scrim') was open over the whole Journal, taking the tap. **Inferred cause:** the find's editor, with its
   identification field focused, now stays composed for its slide out (a leaving page), instead of leaving in the same frame the
   search header comes back; focus then lands on the search field and opens its dropdown (the same class of race the comments in
   `CartographyScreen` and `AvailabilityScreen` record). **Proposed fix:** a leaving page gives up focus the moment it starts to
   leave (clear focus held inside it), in `PageSlide`'s page frame. Not confirmed by a run.

Pushed. Gradle is stopped.

## RECORD -691: the go to fix, and the rebuild, 2026-10-08

**Merge first.** `origin/main` at a71b57ac (data part B) merged in (da48afe8). One conflict, `docs/audits/README.md` (two rows,
both kept); every code file merged on its own, and no logic was changed on both sides.

**1. The album cases: cause confirmed.** The album button is remembered with no key and reads the launchers through
`rememberUpdatedState` (`log/CartographyScreen.kt`). The three tests that never went idle now pass **unchanged**:
`AvailabilityScreenJournalShortWindowTest` 26/26 and `JournalShortWindowCardsTest` 13/13.

**2. F1: not fixed. Two fixes were tried, and both were measured and removed.** A diagnostic copy of the test (thrown away
afterwards) logged, frame by frame after Back, which node had focus and whether the search dropdown's scrim was open:
- **As first built** (no change): the find editor's field keeps focus for the whole slide out, 22 frames. On the frame the page
  goes, focus moves to the search field (`active-search-summary`), and the dropdown opens on the next frame.
- **Attempt 1**, clearing focus when a page starts to leave: focus lands on the search field in the first frame, and the
  dropdown opens on the second.
- **Attempt 2**, moving the focus to the slide's own container, which stays: the same as attempt 1, from the first frame.
- So whenever focus leaves the editor while the search field is back above the Journal, focus ends on the search field. Before
  this part the editor and the search field swapped in one composition. The comment at `AvailabilityCompactScaffold.kt`'s
  `isEditingJournalEntry` records the same race from an earlier dispatch: a `clearFocus` while the search bar is back
  "left it as the only focusable candidate". Both attempts are removed, and a note sits in their place in `PageSlide.kt`'s page frame.
- **Under CLAUDE.md's two-failed-attempts rule this stops here.** The options are for the owner and planner:
  - (a) hold the search bar back on the Journal until no Journal page is leaving;
  - (b) have the search field open its dropdown only on a real tap, not on any focus;
  - (c) let the find editor leave at once, without its slide.

**3. Parts 1 and 2's leaving pieces now get no minimum touch target while they leave:** map pop-ups (`MapPopUp`), the compass strip,
the navigation display, the strip's readout swap, the search dropdown, the leaving tab and the leaving bar or rail. Each is wrapped
in `NoTouchTargetExpansion` with its own leaving flag.
- **New test `availability/SmallLeavingChipTest`**: the 32 dp taxon chip, made to leave by a real tap on its clear button.
  Long-presses on its label, and 4 dp below it, reach the map. It passes.
- **But it does not bite.** Revert check R15 (the pop-up's wrapper turned off) still passed, so the test is labelled a pin, not
  evidence for the change.
- **Why it doesn't bite:** over the map, a touch near a small leaving pop-up is still a direct hit on the map beneath it, and a
  direct hit wins over a near one. The gap shows only where nothing beneath takes the touch directly.
- **That case is evidenced:** revert check R16, which turns the same wrapper off on list rows, failed `ListMotionTest`'s Entries
  card case ("a leaving card opens nothing ... was [e-2]").
- **So the Part 1 and 2 wrappers are a guard, not a fix of an observed failure.** No test here shows a map pop-up taking a touch
  without them.
- Revert checks R15 and R16 ran like the others: saved copy, compile log checked first (clean), only fresh XML read, the file
  restored and its checksum matched.

**Full suite:** 4,208 tests, 24 skipped, **1 failure**, all XML fresh from the run. The failure is
`LeavingTheJournalFixesTest` F1, as above, untouched. `AvailabilityScreenSettingsPanelTest` passed. `./gradlew --stop` ran, and no
Gradle or Kotlin daemon is left. Free disk stayed between 4.4 and 4.7 GB.
