# Search keyboard, recent search, Clear, suggestions, guidance text

Dispatch 2026-09-28-722 (RECORD intent -722; preserved at `prompts/preserved/2026-10-08-02.md`), with four additions relayed
by the planner into the same build: RECORD -723 (recent-search bug and a Clear button), -724 (replaced by -725 before any of
it was built), -725 with its clarification -726 (species suggestions), and -727 (the Trip Windows guidance text). Branch
`search-keyboard`, cut from `origin/main` at `bfbba33f` (the base the dispatch names; fetched and confirmed before cutting).
No PR. Paths are relative to `app/src/main/java/com/zynergylabs/forager/app/` unless they start with `app/` or `docs/`.

**Status: built and run; full suite 4,410 tests, 2 failures (existing tests whose premise -725 removed, not touched).** Gradle started only after `systemctl --user is-active t6b-night` read `inactive` (12:14:20 UTC).
Every behaviour claim below rests on a test named beside it; what no Robolectric test can show is listed under "Device only".

## 1. The keyboard covers the dropdown's bottom row (-722)

**Cause, confirmed from history.** `0777e671` (RECORD -697) removed `coordinatesKeptInView`, the keep-in-view that scrolled
the panel to its end each time its viewport changed, together with the scroll-to-the-end on open. The panel's cap follows the
keyboard (`AvailabilityCompactScaffold.kt`, `searchDropdownImeBottom`), so with nothing scrolling it the keyboard's arrival
shrank the viewport and left the end, now Set on map and Search, under the keyboard. Confirmed by the revert check R1 below:
with the restored keep-in-view switched off, Search sits 66 dp below the panel's bottom after the shrink.

**Fix.** `AvailabilitySearchUi.kt`, `SearchDropdown`: `bottomRowKeptInView`, on from the panel's open. Each time the viewport
**shrinks** the panel scrolls to its end; the first size and any growth are left alone, so the panel still opens at its top
with the coordinates first (-697). A `DragInteraction.Start` turns it off until the next open (the panel leaves composition
on close). That is the old T3b rule.

**Tests** (`SearchDropdownKeyboardTest`, T3a/T3b restored for the new layout, T3c added):
- T3a: 800 to 360 dp; the panel scrolled; Search and Set on map each end 20 dp above the panel's bottom (16 dp padding plus
  the 4 dp a 40 dp button leaves under itself in its 48 dp touch target, measured on the first run; the first draft said 16
  and failed on that, which is how the 4 dp was found); five real coordinate touches across each button reach it.
- T3b: shrink, two real drags back to the top (Latitude 16 dp below the panel's top), then 420 and 360 again: Latitude is
  still 16 dp below the top.
- T3c (two tests): with no shrink, Latitude is 16 dp below the top at 800 dp, and at 360 dp when the panel opens that short.

## 2. A recent search tapped: "Dropdown closes, nothing new" (-723)

**Reproduced first** (`RecentSearchShowsOnMapTest`, real screen, real ViewModel via the new `RealSearchScreenRig`, real
touches in touch mode; the map's input read from the `MapSlot` the screen composes). Before the fix:
- An **earlier** recent search (A searched, then B, then A's row touched) **passed**: the map was handed A's observations.
- The recent search **already showing**, touched again, **failed**: the map was handed nothing (`expected [A's sighting] but
  was []`).

**Cause, confirmed.** `AvailabilityViewModel.refresh` clears the sightings and expects the visible tab to fetch them again.
That fetch is `AvailabilityScreen`'s `LaunchedEffect(selectedTab, region, month, filter)`. Re-running the search already
showing changes none of the four keys, so the effect never re-ran and the map stayed empty. Not the other two candidates: the
row's touch reached `onRecentSearchSelected` (the region was set), and refresh published.

**Not confirmed:** that the owner tapped the search already showing. Robolectric shows only that case failing. If they tapped
a different search and saw nothing, the cause is something this rig does not reproduce (a device-only path, for example the
live API or camera framing); the device step below separates the two.

**Fix.** `AvailabilityUiState.searchSerial`, bumped by every `refresh`, is a fifth key of that effect. Revert R4 brings the
failure back.

**Month and radius (-725 item 2).** `onRecentSearchSelected` already restored the search's own month and radius; kept, and
tested: a search saved at next month and 25 km runs with that month and 25 km (state, ranked-list fetch, sightings fetch and
the map's input). Revert R5 (current month instead) fails it: `expected 11 but was 10`.

## 3. Clear on the search bar (-723)

`SearchEntryBar`: a "Clear" `TextButton` at the bar's right end, a sibling of the field (so a tap on it never focuses the
field), shown only while `region != null`. Both bars (Maps tab and the other tabs) get it. It calls the new
`AvailabilityViewModel.clearSearch()`, wired in `MainActivity`.

**Clear's touch target is the field's height (about 29 dp) by the button's width, not 48 dp.** The first full suite found a
48 dp Clear grew the bar from 45 to 61 dp whenever a search showed, which moved the landscape L and cluster (13 failures in
`LandscapeLRulingsTest`, `LandscapeLFullscreenCycleTest`, `AvailabilityScreenTabletAsPhoneTest`,
`LayoutFixesShortLandscapeTest`, all "the L's top 45 ... the search bar's bottom 61"). The bar's height is the owner's own
earlier ask, so Clear gives way: `LocalMinimumInteractiveComponentSize` unset and `height(fieldHeight)` (`c85dcc6a`). A
smaller target than Material's 48 dp is a trade the owner may want to rule on. The 29 dp is twice labelMedium's "Mg" height,
computed, not measured.

Tests (`SearchBarClearTest`): the bar's height is the same with Clear showing as without; nothing searched, no Clear; five real touches across Clear, each after a fresh search, each
leaving the map empty, region and ranked list null, the summary reading "Search a location", recent searches unchanged, Clear
gone and no dropdown opened; and a ranked-list fetch held open when Clear is touched, then released, puts nothing back.

## 4. Species suggestions (-725, -726; -724 replaced)

-724 (auto-search on a suggestion) was never built; -725 replaced it before the code was written. Now a suggestion tap
selects the species (the bar names it), closes only the suggestion list, and leaves the search dropdown open, the field
focused and the keyboard up. No fetch runs.

- `AvailabilityViewModel.onTaxonSearchResultSelected` no longer searches again when a region is showing (it did on `main`).
- Both scaffold call sites no longer set `showSearchDropdown = false` on a suggestion.
- **Found at the build:** even with no search call, the screen's lazy-fetch effect (keyed on the filter) fetched the picked
  species' sightings for the old region, a search by another name. `onMapTabSelected` and `onSeasonalTabSelected` now read
  `activeSearch`, the region, month and filter `refresh` last ran (cleared by `clearSearch`), not the UI state's current
  filter. Revert R11 brings the extra fetch back.

Tests (`SpeciesSuggestionKeepsSearchOpenTest`, real touches inside the suggestion popup, with a search showing and with
none): suggestion list gone, dropdown displayed, field focused, keyboard up (Robolectric's shadow `InputMethodManager`, with a
positive control that it reads up after the bar's tap), filter is the species, the bar shows it; no ranked-list or sightings
fetch, and with nothing searched no location request.

## 5. Trip Windows guidance text removed (-727)

Removed: the divider and guidance section in `ui/availability/AvailabilityTripWindowsUi.kt` (`ForagingWeatherGuidanceSection`
with it), and `ForagingWeatherGuidance` (its `Guidance` and `forSelection`, the whole object) from
`domain/ForagingWeatherGuidance.kt`. No caller is left (`git grep` for `ForagingWeatherGuidance.`, `forSelection`,
`Guidance(`). Kept: `ForagingSelection` and its group, which recent searches store and restore.

`TripWindowsGuidanceTextTest` now asserts no guidance text (each heading and a phrase from each paragraph, including the two
-695 texts) for the Fungi category, a fungus, a plant and an unknown group, with the card shown. Revert R12 (both files back
as on `main`) fails three of four: fungi category, fungus, plant. The unknown group passes under the revert, as it should:
it never had text.

**Tests deleted** (they tested removed code), from `ForagingWeatherGuidanceTest`:
`fungi guidance states the rain lag pattern and hedges it as a rule of thumb`;
`fungi guidance quotes the soil temperature band from the labelled assumption`;
`under the imperial setting the fungi guidance quotes the band in Fahrenheit`;
`under the metric setting the band reads exactly as before`;
`plants guidance is not the fungi text`;
`plants guidance says plainly that there is no weather pattern to offer`;
`a category with no written guidance shows none rather than borrowing another's`;
`a specific species shows exactly its category's guidance`;
`a specific species carries no species note and nothing names it`;
`a species with no known group shows no guidance at all`;
`the lichens chip is not given the fungi fruiting pattern, or any other`;
`of the default selections, fungi and plants have guidance and lichens has none`;
`no guidance text states a score, probability or best day`.
Its three `ForagingSelection` tests are kept, unchanged, as `domain/ForagingSelectionTest.kt`.

From `TripWindowsGuidanceTextTest`, replaced by the four above: `a fungus species picked by name shows the fungi pattern and
no species note`; `the fungi category shows the fungi pattern and no species note`; `a fungus species reopened from a recent
search shows the fungi pattern and no species note`; `a species in a group with no written guidance shows no guidance block
at all`.

**Existing tests changed** (they read the removed text), `AvailabilityScreenLayoutTest`:
- `the drawer's Trip Planner section shows the trip windows card once a region is searched`: scrolled to the guidance heading
  as an anchor; now scrolls to the card's last line, then its title. Same assertions otherwise.
- `under the imperial setting ... and the guidance band read in Fahrenheit` renamed `... soil temperature reads in
  Fahrenheit`; its "roughly 50–68 °F" assertion removed.
- `under the metric setting ... and the guidance band read as before` renamed `... soil temperature reads as before`; its
  "roughly 10–20 °C" assertion removed.

**Left in place, now unread:** `FruitingPatternAssumptions.TEMPERATE_FRUITING_SOIL_TEMPERATURE_C` (`domain/
FruitingPatternAssumptions.kt:83`) had one reader, the removed fungi text. -727 says to keep anything still read; this is no
longer read. Not deleted here; the owner or planner decides.

## Decided beyond scope (each reversible, each the reading I took)

1. **What Clear clears.** The owner named the map's observations and the summary. Clearing only those would leave the List,
   rainfall, trip windows and seasonal tabs showing a search the bar says is not there, so Clear clears the region and every
   result fetched for it, and cancels fetches still running (`searchJobs`, a supervisor job all search fetches now run in).
   **Kept:** recent searches (as asked), month, radius, the species selection and the coordinate fields. The species stays,
   so after Clear the summary reads "<species> · October · Search a location" if a species was selected; with none,
   "October · Search a location". If the owner meant the species to go too, that is one line in `clearSearch`.
2. **Clear while a search is loading** shows (the region is set) and works (tested).
3. **The map follows the search last run** (`activeSearch`), not the current filter, which is what makes "no search yet"
   true; a month change still searches again, as on `main`.

## Revert checks

Runner: saves each edited file to a copy, applies the edit, runs only the named classes in a fresh capped scope, refuses
results if the build log has an `e: ` line, reads JUnit XML only if its timestamp is after the run started, restores from
the saved copy (never git) and confirms the restored file is byte-identical to the copy. `git status` was clean afterwards.
All thirteen compiled, all fresh, all restored identical; after R13 the forward change was confirmed present (`grep`) before it was committed.

| R13 | Clear back to a 48 dp target | SearchBarClearTest, LandscapeLRulingsTest | 1/4, 6/18 | "the bar's height with Clear expected 45 but was 61"; "at rest the L's top 45.0 is not above the search bar's bottom 61.0" (and B1's "still rests at the search bar's bottom 61.0") |
| R12 | guidance back as on `main` | TripWindowsGuidanceTextTest | 3/4 | "found '1' node ... 'Rain and fungi: the general pattern'" (two), "... 'Rain and plants: no pattern to offer'" |

Each failure is one that its own edit could produce, and none names a test another edit would break.

## Full suite

**Final run (after `c85dcc6a`): 4,410 tests in 564 classes, 24 skipped, 2 failures, 0 errors** (counted from the JUnit XML,
which agrees with Gradle's "4410 tests completed, 2 failed, 24 skipped"). The results directory was emptied before the run,
so every XML is from it.

**The 2 failures are existing tests broken by the intended -725 change, and are not touched** (the dispatch: report any
existing test that breaks, with its reason, before touching it). Both in `AvailabilityViewModelSeasonalPatternTest`:
- `changing the category invalidates the cached seasonal pattern and refetches on next open`: it picks a species with
  `onTaxonSearchResultSelected` and expects the seasonal pattern cleared and fetched again. Since -725 a pick runs no search,
  so the pattern for the search that ran stays (`expected null, but was FruitingLagDistribution(... Fungi ...)`).
- `an IconicCategory filter and a SpecificTaxon filter both reach the seasonal fetch unchanged`: it picks a species and
  expects the seasonal fetch to see the species filter; since -725 it sees it only once a search runs with it.
Both premises are the behaviour the owner removed ("no search yet"). The likely rewrite: after the pick, run the search
(`searchManualCoordinates`), then expect the refetch with the species filter; that keeps what each test is about (a new
filter invalidates the cache; both filter kinds reach the fetch). Not done: it is the owner's or planner's call.

**First run (before `c85dcc6a`): 4,409 tests, 24 skipped, 15 failures.** The same 2, plus 13 landscape tests that my first
Clear broke by growing the bar (see section 3). Those were fixed in my code, not in the tests; all 13 pass in the final run.

Free disk: 3.6 GB at the start of the session, 3.3 GB after the final run.

## Gradle

- Waited for `t6b-night` to read `inactive` (12:14:20 UTC, about 7 minutes after the first check); did not touch it.
- Every run: `systemd-run --user --scope -q -p MemoryMax=5G -p MemorySwapMax=0`, Gradle `-Xmx1536m`, Kotlin daemon 2g, Java
  temp `~/.cache/forager-test-tmp` (via `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`), a fresh daemon per scope, `./gradlew --stop` and the Kotlin
  daemon stopped at the end of each scope. Compiled first (main and tests) before any test run.
- Free disk: 3.6 GB at the start, 3.3 GB at the end, never under 1.5 GB.

## Device only

Robolectric reports no keyboard, so the keep-in-view's trigger on a phone (the cap following `WindowInsets.ime`) is device
only. Steps, cheap first, on the S22:
1. Maps tab, tap the search bar. Pass: as the keyboard rises, the panel's bottom row (Set on map, Search) ends just above it.
   Evidence: a screenshot (kept off GitHub).
2. Drag the panel up to the coordinates, tap Latitude. Pass: the panel stays where it was dragged.
3. Search somewhere, then tap that same search in Recent searches. Pass: its observations are on the map. Then tap a
   **different** recent search. Pass: its observations are on the map. If step 3's second half fails, the owner's report has
   a second cause this build did not reproduce.
4. Type a species, tap a suggestion. Pass: the list closes, the panel and keyboard stay, the bar shows the species, the map
   does not change.
5. With a search showing, tap Clear. Pass: map empty, bar reads "Search a location", Recent searches still listed.

## Commits

`1426522e` (-722), `4902a2dd` (-723 recent search), `fa2795a4` (-723 Clear, -725/-726, -727), `1b403fb9` (-725 map reads the
search last run), `c85dcc6a` (Clear's height), and this report's commit. Pushed to `origin/search-keyboard`. No PR.

## Not done

- **"Merge"** in the -723 relay is not done: the dispatch says "No PR", and the relay does not say what to merge into what.
  `origin/main` is still `bfbba33f`, the base, so the branch needs no merge from it. Merging into `main` is left for the
  planner's word.
- The two seasonal-pattern tests above, and the unread constant in section 5.
