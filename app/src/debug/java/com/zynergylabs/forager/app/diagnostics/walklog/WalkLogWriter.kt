/**
 * One walk log file (dispatch 2026-09-28-532, verify item 5).
 *
 * **Storage.** Below [minFreeBytes] free (200 MB, RECORD -559 choice 4) it writes one `STOPPED` line
 * and refuses everything after: at [open], and at every [checkSpace], which the session calls once a
 * minute. A write that fails is the same kind of stop, with reason `write-error`, logged. A stop
 * here never reaches the recording: nothing in this class can throw out of [write] or [checkSpace].
 *
 * **Surviving a killed process.** Lines are buffered and flushed to the file once [FLUSH_INTERVAL_NANOS]
 * has passed since the last flush, so a process killed mid-walk loses at most that much. The file
 * descriptor is synced at each [checkSpace] (once a minute), so a phone that powers off mid-walk
 * loses at most a minute. Opened for append, never truncated.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: the session calls it from one thread.
