/**
 * How wide the compass strip and the navigation display may be in the short-landscape Map tab without reaching the
 * search bar (dispatch 2026-09-28-685, Amendment 1, RECORD -694; the owner: "Stay beside the search bar, '…'
 * (Recommended)"). On the S22 at font scale 2.0 the strip (content-width) and the display (full width up to
 * [LANDSCAPE_HUD_MAX_WIDTH]) grew from the rail's side across the centre line and over the bar, and nothing bounded
 * them by it. Now they stay in the room between the rail-side controls edge and the bar's end; text that does not fit
 * there ends in "…" on one line, so nothing gets taller and the central third's clearance is unchanged.
 *
 * The bar's end is worked out the way the scaffold places the bar (`AvailabilityCompactScaffold`'s
 * `landscapeSearchWidth`): from the punch-hole-side controls edge, `min(LANDSCAPE_SEARCH_MAX_WIDTH, half the window
 * minus that edge's inset minus LANDSCAPE_SEARCH_CENTRE_GAP)`. Recomputed from the same constants rather than read from
 * the bar's measured size, because reading a measured position back through state for placement caused a bisected
 * regression on this screen (`AvailabilityCompactMapUi`'s note on `onGloballyPositioned`).
 *
 * The rejected alternative, placing both below the bar's measured height, would push the display into the window's
 * central third, whose 1.5 dp clearance on the S22 is the owner's to change.

 * RECORD -729 (dispatch 2026-09-28-729), as revised by RECORD -732. The owner, -729: "Landscape mode strip can extend to meet
 * the search bar. The search bar height can change to meet the height of the strip. The two can meet at direct center, and
 * they can be split by a simple vertical line between the two". At -729's build the centre left the strip narrower than the
 * room it already had, so the heading still dropped; asked, the owner, -732: "Join moves to fit the strip (Recommended)".
 *
 * So in a short landscape window, not navigating, the strip is as wide as its readouts need whole (heading, altitude and
 * coordinates, with its needle, padding and three-dot button: [LandscapeStripNeed]), and the search bar takes the rest, never
 * narrower than its own floor ([rememberLandscapeBarFloorPx]: its field's resting text whole, and Clear). Where both cannot
 * fit, the bar keeps its floor and the strip narrows, and readoutsFitBeside decides what it drops; the strip never narrows
 * below the coordinates alone (they never drop), and there the bar gives way. While navigating the display keeps
 * [besideLandscapeSearchBar].
 *
 * Goes **after** `padding(controlsPadding)` on a child aligned to the rail-side top corner, so the width it is offered is the
 * room between the two controls edges. Worked out from text measurements, never read back from a layout. The strip's
 * resulting width (measured on it) is what the scaffold gives the bar as its rail-side padding, so the two meet on the same
 * pixel whatever the rounding. With no rail, or the bar on the rail's side, it changes nothing.
