/**
 * What the Maps tab is given back after a find opened from it is left with Back (dispatch 2026-09-29-57,
 * amendment -256 and, for the shape, amendment -262 item 8, the owner's "Remember and reopen").
 *
 * **Only a return request is remembered**, not the tab's state: the find's id, the keys of the fan that was
 * open (if one was), and the bubble's anchor and bearing, since a bubble cannot be placed without them (see the
 * report's Decisions). The camera is not here: it comes back through [MapCameraMemory], as it always did. The
 * bubble and the fan are rebuilt when the Maps tab is created again: the bubble from the find (still drawn or not),
 * the fan through `MapTapHandler.openFanFor`, with whichever members still exist.
 *
 * Plain Kotlin with no Compose or MapLibre type but an [Offset] (a value), so the rules are headless-testable
 * (`MapReturnMemoryTest`). Held by `AvailabilityScreen` beside its `MapCameraMemory`, so it outlives the tab.
