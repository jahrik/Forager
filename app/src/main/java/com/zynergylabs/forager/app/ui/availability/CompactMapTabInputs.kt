/*
 * Holder classes for [CompactMapTab]'s inputs (RECORD -739).
 *
 * Why these exist: at 67 parameters, CompactMapTab's compiled form was rejected by ART's verifier on
 * every phone that installed main at 0e766d94 (a VerifyError at class load, so the app could not
 * start), while the JVM, Robolectric and CI accepted it. Grouping related parameters into these small
 * classes shrinks the method's signature, and the generated `$changed`/`$default` bookkeeping with it.
 * No behaviour changes: [CompactMapTab] unpacks each holder into locals with the old parameter names
 * at its top, so its body reads exactly as it did. Each field keeps the doc comment its parameter had.
 * The rejected alternative, disabling verification or changing build flags, would hide the next one.
 * The report is `docs/audits/2026-10-08-launch-verifyerror-report.md`.
