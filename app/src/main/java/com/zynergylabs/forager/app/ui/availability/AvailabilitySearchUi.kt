package com.zynergylabs.forager.app.ui.availability

// Split-AvailabilityScreen Stage C: the search UI, moved verbatim out of AvailabilityScreen.kt —
// SearchEntryBar, SearchDropdown, SpeciesSearchControls, SearchNotice,
// SearchControls, RecentSearchesSection, MonthSelector,
// CollapsibleSection, their private helpers (activeSearchSummary, RecentSearchRow,
// TaxonSuggestionContent) and the four internal test-tag constants. Same package as Stage A, for
// the same reason: the seven test files that reach the tags and the log package's own
// CollapsibleSection import all resolve unchanged. Pure move: no signature, name or body changed.
// Six composables went private -> internal because their callers stay in AvailabilityScreen.kt;
// three symbols that stayed there (TripPlannerSection, CompassStripBackgroundColorDark/Light) went
// internal because code here composes them.

/**
 * The top search bar, replacing the old read-only summary that opened [SearchDropdown] — map/navigation
 * redesign dispatch D, the project owner's own direct call:
 * "the search bar at the top should be the entry field for searches," with the old read-only
 * summary-that-opens-a-second-text-field removed as the redundant "second search bar"
 * it had become. (That summary, `ActiveSearchSummary`, survived on the tablet's results pane until the
 * tablet tree was removed, dispatch 2026-09-28-245.) [SpeciesSearchControls]' own species field is hosted here directly — the same field
 * [SearchDropdown] used to host a second copy of one tap deeper — so typing happens right where the
 * bar already reads as a search field, not behind an extra tap into a nested panel. No chevron: the
 * leading search icon [SpeciesSearchControls] itself doesn't draw, so this bar draws its own, is
 * what the owner call singled out as already making the field read as tappable without one.
 *
 * **Tap-to-focus, dismiss-elsewhere**, not the old tap-to-toggle: focusing the species field
 * ([onFieldFocused], wired at the call site to `showSearchDropdown = true`) opens [SearchDropdown]
 * below it, the same panel as before (recent searches, location, radius, month) — but there is no
 * second tap on this bar that closes it again, since a real, focused text field doesn't
 * conventionally close on a second tap the way a toggle button did. Closing happens by the back
 * button (existing `BackHandler`, unchanged), by picking a result/recent search, or by tapping
 * outside the panel — see that call site's own `SEARCH_DROPDOWN_SCRIM_TAG` doc comment for the
 * last one, a real gap the old toggle model never had to fill (tapping the bar again always worked
 * before; a focused field has no such self-closing gesture).
 *
 * **80% opacity, themed for night/day, with a themed divider along the bottom** — the project
 * owner's own direct ask, once this bar started sitting immediately above [CompassElevationStrip]
 * on the Map tab (previously two fully-opaque, unrelated-looking strips; now two translucent ones
 * that need a real seam between them to read as separate surfaces rather than one blurred one).
 * [MapIconStackButtonColorDark]/[MapIconStackButtonColorLight] reused as-is for the 80% fill — that
 * pair already sits at exactly 0.8 alpha, so no second multiplier is layered on top — and
 * [MAP_ICON_STACK_BORDER_COLOR_DARK]/[MAP_ICON_STACK_BORDER_COLOR_LIGHT] for the [HorizontalDivider],
 * the same hairline-border pair already drawn against that exact fill everywhere else in this map
 * chrome family ([MapIconBar], [ControlPill]), rather than a new one-off colour.
 * [LocalForagerDarkTheme], not the app's own system light/dark [MaterialTheme.colorScheme]: this
 * bar sits immediately above map chrome that already keys off that same night/day concept
 * (`isDarkTheme` throughout this file), and reads as one coherent system with it rather than two
 * surfaces following two different theme signals stacked on top of each other.

/**
 * Map/navigation redesign dispatch C: the compact window's entire search surface, floating over
 * whatever tab content is currently showing (usually the map) from where quick species search used
 * to sit — the quick panel is gone rather than kept alongside this one. Started as just item 1's "advanced search" (location/radius/month); a
 * follow-up owner call folded species search and Recent Searches in too, on the same "one place
 * instead of two" reasoning item 1 itself already argued for its own content — those had been
 * living in the Tools drawer, one tap further away and split across two surfaces from location
 * search's own new home.
 *
 * **Radius and month promoted to this surface's own top level, alongside basic search — Advanced
 * search is location only now.** Originally shaped with radius/month nested inside "Advanced
 * search" alongside location; the project owner asked directly for radius and month to move up to
 * "normal search" instead, on the reasoning both are reached for on nearly every search the same
 * way species/category already are, unlike location (set on map/use current location/manual
 * coordinates), which stays gated one tap deeper since most searches don't need to override it.
 *
 * **Composed after the tab content in the same [Box] at its call site, so it draws on top by
 * composition order alone** — the same "later-composed wins" rule already governing the Tools
 * drawer's own relationship to the tab content it overlays. Understory's four over-the-map rules
 * apply here as an entry condition, not a guideline (dispatch C's own text, since this surface sits
 * over the map when expanded):
 * 1. No [Surface] — a plain [Box] with [background], the same non-intercepting shape
 *    [CompassElevationStripContent] already uses, so nothing here swallows a touch meant for the
 *    map underneath once this closes.
 * 2. No scroll modifier *for content that lets the map still show through it* — the reason this
 *    panel used to call [SpeciesSearchControls] with `chipRowScrollable = false` before dispatch D
 *    moved that composable's own field out into [SearchEntryBar] (a category chip row's own default
 *    `horizontalScroll` is exactly the pointer-handler-with-nothing-to-scroll shape that rule bans
 *    for a thin decorative strip, though not a concern for this panel's own remaining content, none
 *    of which scrolls horizontally). This whole panel is a different case regardless: rule 1's
 *    [background] (at the map chrome's alpha, so the map shows through it) already blocks every touch within its bounds from reaching the map
 *    underneath, so once opened it behaves like the drawer's own [SearchControls] sheet, not like
 *    the compass strip — and on the smallest
 *    supported phone (`w360dp-h640dp-xhdpi`), the panel as it stood before dispatch
 *    2026-09-28-697 (both coordinate folds expanded) genuinely didn't fit in the space [compactMainScaffold] hands this
 *    surface (`Modifier.weight(1f)`'s remaining height below the summary bar and above the bottom
 *    nav), which is exactly the "starved children, nothing scrolled, simply unreachable" failure
 *    this file's own `Column`-without-`verticalScroll` doc comment already describes for the old
 *    stacked layout. So the inner [Column] below carries [Modifier.verticalScroll], the same
 *    "`weight(1f)` gives a bounded, not infinite, height to scroll within" pattern already used for
 *    [SearchControls], the offline map picker, and the settings panel in this same file — proven
 *    safe here by [AvailabilityScreenLayoutTest]'s own "every advanced-search dropdown control is
 *    reachable" test at that exact device config.
 * 3. Full width is the deliberate choice here, not left to default [fillMaxWidth] creep: a
 *    location/radius/month panel needs real width for its fields and slider to be usable, the same
 *    reasoning [CompassElevationStripContent]'s own doc comment already states for going full width.
 * 4. A long-press/real-touch test accompanies this, per [AvailabilityScreenMapIconStackTest]'s own
 *    "item 5" precedent from Dispatch A.
 *
 * Item 2 of dispatch C — location input, SIDE BY SIDE: "Set on map" reuses the exact same
 * pan-to-centre-pin-plus-confirm flow every other pin placement in this app already uses
 * ([CentrePinLocationPickerOverlay], surfaced over [CompactMapTab]'s own real map — see
 * `compactMainScaffold`'s `pickingSearchLocationOnMap` state for the plumbing), not a second
 * picker. Since dispatch 2026-09-28-697 it sits on the left of the bottom row, beside Search.
 *
 * Item 3 — manual coordinates: once collapsed by default under "Enter coordinates manually" inside
 * "Advanced search"; since dispatch 2026-09-28-697 both folds are gone and Latitude and Longitude
 * are this panel's first row, searched by the "Search coordinates" button under them (RECORD -700).
 * The bottom row's Search is "Use current location" renamed and moved (see the body's comment).
 *
 * Item 4 — the "redundant list" this dispatch asks to confirm and remove: none exists. The only
 * list this drawer's advanced-search content has ever shown is [ResultsSection]'s ranked species
 * list, and that has exactly one call site, inside [ListTab] — nothing resembling it lived in
 * [RegionControls]/[MonthSelector] (the content this dropdown's own radius/month controls are
 * drawn from) before this dispatch, confirmed by reading both, so there is nothing to remove.
