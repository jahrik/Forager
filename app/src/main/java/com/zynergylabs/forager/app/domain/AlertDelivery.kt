 * and walked into the woods has opted into being told they have strayed. The owner's revised
 * reading: straying is often deliberate, so off-track is the kind of thing a person may reasonably
 * want to hear only if their notifications are audible, whereas [AlertKind.HEADS_UP], [AlertKind.LEAVE_BY] and
 * [AlertKind.SUNSET] are about not being stranded after dark and override silence. The parameter
 * existing per call is what made this a one-line reversal rather than a redesign. **Do not

/**
 * The owned seam through which anything in this app interrupts the user — a notification, a
 * vibration, whatever the platform implementation decides an [Alert] is made of. Domain and
 * ViewModel code call this; the Android implementation lives in `com.zynergylabs.forager.app.alert`.
 *
 * **Why this exists (alert-delivery dispatch).** The off-track alert used to be delivered from a
 * `LaunchedEffect` in `MainActivity`'s composition, keyed on a counter the ViewModel bumped. The
 * *decision* — `TrackRecordingViewModel.returnToStart`, fed by its own location collection in
 * `viewModelScope` — already ran with the Activity stopped, but Compose's window recomposer pauses
 * below `STARTED`, so the effect, and with it the notification and the vibration, waited for the
 * next resume. The owner walked off-track with the phone in a pocket and got the alert when the
 * screen came on. Delivery now goes through this interface, called directly from the decision, and
 * the composed path is gone: there is one call site and no counter.
 *
 * **A hole this does not close, recorded here so the next person finds it without archaeology.**
 * The decision lives in `TrackRecordingViewModel`, whose lifetime is the Activity's: it survives
 * the Activity being *stopped* (screen off, pocketed, app backgrounded — the case this dispatch
 * fixed, because `TrackRecordingService` keeps the process alive while recording), but **if the
 * task is swiped away while recording, the Activity is destroyed, the ViewModel is cleared, and
 * the off-track decision dies with it** — the returning flag, the rolling window and the cooldown
 * are all ViewModel state. The foreground service keeps recording points (`START_STICKY`), so the
 * track is fine; nothing will ever say "off track" again for that recording. This predates the
 * change (the decision was already in the ViewModel) and is not fixed by it. Closing it means
 * moving navigation ownership — returning state, start point, window, cooldown, and this call —
 * into the service, with the ViewModel as a mirror. That is a real hole in a safety feature and a
 * decision the owner has not yet made.
 *
 * **Closed for the off-track alert (dispatch 2026-09-28-400, Amendment 2; the owner chose
 * "Option B").** The two paragraphs above are left as they were written, as the record of the
 * hole. The decision, the returning flag, the start point, the window, the cooldown and the call
 * to [deliver] are now [ReturnWatch]'s. It is held by `AppContainer` and begun, fed and ended by
 * `TrackRecordingService`, and the ViewModel calls it and copies its state. So the one call site
 * is `ReturnWatch.onFix`, not `TrackRecordingViewModel.returnToStart`, and a swiped-away app
 * still alerts for as long as the service runs. What is still open: a reopened app does not yet
 * show the recording it left (Part 3 of that dispatch), and the two sundown alerts have no caller
 * (plan task T2).
 *
 * **The sundown alerts now have one (dispatch 2026-09-28-516):** [SundownWatch], held by
 * `AppContainer` and driven by `TrackRecordingService` the same way, and three of them, not two.
