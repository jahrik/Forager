/**
 * MapLibre's offline-region and tile-resource database is left where the SDK puts it. Observed on
 * hardware (the S22 and the tablet, `device-evidence/2026-09-28-*`): `files/mbgl-offline.db` under
 * the app's files directory, which Android's "Clear cache" does not touch.
 *
 * **Rejected: redirecting it.** This file used to call `FileSource.setResourcesCachePath` to a
 * `files/maplibre-offline` directory before `MapLibre.getInstance`. That ordering made
 * `getInstance`'s configuration check throw `MapLibreConfigurationException` on the first call of
 * every process, so the redirect never took effect, and the comments here that called the default
 * "the cache dir" were wrong about where the live store is. Making the redirect succeed would have
 * pointed MapLibre at an empty directory while every saved region's tiles sat in
 * `files/mbgl-offline.db`. Dropped, not fixed (dispatch 2026-09-28-106, F1).
 *
 * [initializeMapLibre] is the one function every entry point calls instead of
 * `MapLibre.getInstance()`; `ForagerApplication.onCreate` calls it at process start so nothing
 * reads or composes a map before MapLibre is initialised (F2).
