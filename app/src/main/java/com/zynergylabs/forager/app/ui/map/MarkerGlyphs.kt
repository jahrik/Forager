/**
 * The map's bitmap marker silhouettes (colour build C2 (d)), each distinct in shape as well as
 * colour, since the owner found that "color isn't enough" to tell the markers apart. The geometry is
 * the glyph board's (`docs/audits/2026-09-26-marker-glyph-board.md` §1, with its §2 shape choices),
 * ported from its Python polygons to Android [Path]s, plus the search centre's reticle, which the
 * owner changed after the board (arms extending beyond the ring).
 *
 * Every dimension is in dp, measured from the top-left of the glyph's **fill extent** (its fill, not
 * counting the casing). The anchor is the point that sits on the feature's coordinate.
 *
 * Differences from the board's Python, recorded rather than silent:
 *  - **Waypoint.** The board's `pin_poly` is the head's upper half-circle joined to the tip, which
 *    drops the parts of the head's lower half that lie outside the triangle. Its §1 text describes
 *    today's `waypointPinBitmap` instead (the whole head circle and a triangle from its equator to
 *    the tip), and that is what is drawn here.
 *  - **Casing.** The board grew each polygon by 1.5dp with a round-joined stroke; here each fill part
 *    is stroked 3dp wide with round joins in the casing colour, then filled on top. That is the same
 *    footprint, drawn with the platform's stroker instead of a polygon approximation.
 *  - **Curves.** Arcs are true Path arcs and circles, not the board's 120- to 180-point polygons.
 *  - **Flag and find size.** The board's flag is 20 x 28 and its mushroom 24 x 26. Dispatch 2026-09-28-286 draws both
 *    evenly scaled to 25 dp tall, anchors included (the flag 17.86 x 25, the mushroom 23.08 x 25); the casing and detail
 *    strokes are not scaled. The owner, of an S22 photo: "I noticed the flag for the planned trip is a bit large compared
 *    to the other icons. Can its size be reduced a bit to visually align with the other icons? The finds icon is a bit
 *    large also, but not by much. Location pin icon is acceptable. Somewhere between the photo icon and location pin size
 *    would be preferable"; scope, "Everywhere". The coordinates in [parts] below are the design's, times [MarkerGlyph.scale].
 *    Dispatch 2026-09-28-358 then drew the flag alone at 23 dp tall ([PLANNED_TRIP_HEIGHT_DP]; 16.43 x 23, anchor (1.23, 23)),
 *    the find staying at 25. The owner, after seeing it in its 36 dp circle: "The circle size was perfect at 36dp since the trip
 *    icon fit neatly in it", and "the trip icon is a bit large still. Scale it down very slightly so that it fits more
 *    comfortably inside the circle." The 23 is the planner's number, not the owner's; scope again everywhere, as for -286.
 *  - **Search centre.** The board drew a plus 3dp from the centre, inside the ring. The owner's
 *    tweak puts the arms beyond the ring: see [SEARCH_CENTRE_ARM_DP].
