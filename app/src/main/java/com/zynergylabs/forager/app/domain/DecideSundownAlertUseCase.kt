/**
 * Decides whether a recording should alert, given where the day is, how long the walk back is,
 * and what has already fired.
 *
 * Pure and stateless: the caller owns the memory of what has fired ([SundownWatch]).
 *
 * ## The leave-by time
 *
 * Sunset, minus the darkness margin ([SundownCountdown.Known.turnaroundAtEpochMillis] is sunset
 * minus the margin), minus the walk back. With the walk back unknown (`null`), it falls back to
 * sunset minus the margin: the dispatch's fallback, and never a confident figure the estimate
 * does not have. It moves earlier as the walk back grows, which is why it is recomputed on every
 * call rather than fixed at the start.
 *
 * ## Edge-triggered, once each
 *
 * All three are moments, not conditions. Passing [SundownAlertDecision.spent] back in is what
 * makes each fire once for a recording.
 *
 * ## A later moment supersedes earlier ones that were never delivered
 *
 * If more than one is already behind (a recording started late, or a walk back that grew past
 * now), only the latest fires and the earlier ones are marked spent without sounding. Two alarms
 * in the same second is noise, and the later one is the truer.
 *
 * ## What does not alert
 *
 * [SundownCountdown.NoPositionYet] has no place to compute against.
 * [SundownCountdown.SunDoesNotSet] has no sunset to be late for. [SundownCountdown.SunStaysDown]
 * is polar night: the light did not go while they were out, it was never there.
