/**
 * The strip's Location chip (decision B8 / Closed decision D, 2026-09-26): shows and sets Settings'
 * "Automatically Save Location to Photos" — the one stored value, not a per-shot override. The B3
 * mirror: the camera and Settings are two views of the same setting.
 *
 * **[autoSaveLocationToPhotos] is the stored value**, handed down from `AvailabilityScreen`'s
 * `uiState` the way "Lock camera to portrait" is. A tap calls [onAutoSaveLocationToPhotosChanged]
 * with the toggled value — the same handler Settings' checkbox calls — and changes nothing here;
 * the chip shows the new value when the screen's state has it. It never writes the repository.
 *
 * Built like [GridChip]: [OverlayIcon] for the outline rule, [rotateWithDevice] to turn in place,
 * one mapping so icon and label cannot disagree. Always present, last in the strip.
 *
 * **Glyphs:** `LocationOn` (material-icons-core) and `LocationOff` (material-icons-extended), both
 * already on the app's classpath. Whether each reads at a glance over a scene is the owner's
 * verdict on the device.
