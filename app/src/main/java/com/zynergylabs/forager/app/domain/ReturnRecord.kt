 * A lasting record of Return taps and the off-track rule's decisions (dispatch 2026-09-28-451).
 *
 * The owner's walk of 2026-10-03 could not be read afterwards: the app's own log lines before
 * 20:12:10Z had rotated away, and nothing else recorded when Return was tapped
 * (`docs/navigation/2026-10-03-walk-findings-report.md`). This is that record. It changes nothing a
 * walker sees.
 *
 * **No positions:** times, track ids, decisions and reasons only.
