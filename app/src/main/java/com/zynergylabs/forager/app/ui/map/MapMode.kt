/**
 * The two basemap looks a user picks between: Street and Topographical, both OpenStreetMap-derived,
 * from the Layers sheet's "Map type" row (`MapLayersSheet`) or the quick-fire [MapModePicker].
 * Replaced the deleted `MapService` entirely, per the project owner's own request.
 *
 * `MapService` used to split this choice into two decisions with two different lifetimes — which
 * *service* (occasional, Settings) and which *mode* that service was in (frequent, a quick-fire
 * icon over the map). That split existed because `Basemap.USGS_TOPO` and `Basemap.USGS_IMAGERY_TOPO`
 * were live alternatives to OpenStreetMap's own topo/regular pair, worth choosing between. Neither
 * is any more: [STREET] and [TOPOGRAPHIC] are pinned to OpenStreetMap outright, so there is exactly
 * one decision — which look this map currently has. The Settings "Choose Maps Service" section this
 * superseded is deleted, not left dead.
 *
 * **Satellite was a third mode, removed by dispatch 2026-09-28-708**, to be revisited once the
 * forecast's habitat layers are on the map. The owner: "Satellite loses quality fast and is less
 * useful when zoomed in", then "Remove now, revisit later (Recommended)". See [Basemap]'s class doc.
 *
 * **The choice persists across restarts** (same dispatch). The owner, to the step path: "have the app
 * remember which map modes you had it on last so we don't have to keep switching to the favorite".
 * It is stored by [storageKey], not by enum name, so renaming an entry cannot orphan what a phone
 * already holds; [forStoredKey] reads it back. Before this the mode was session-only and reset to
 * [DEFAULT] on every launch.
