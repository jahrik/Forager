/**
 * Delivers a recording's "Back by" alert (dispatch 2026-09-28-645, plan task T15; Amendments 1 and
 * 2, RECORD -646 and -647). See [BackByChoice] for the owner's path.
 *
 * ## Who drives it
 *
 * Held by `AppContainer` for the life of the process and driven by `TrackRecordingService`, the way
 * [SundownWatch] and [ReturnWatch] are, so it fires with the app swiped away and needs **no
 * exact-alarm permission**: [begin] when a recording starts, [onFix] for every raw fix, [tick] on the
 * service's own 15 s timer, [end] when the recording stops or the service is destroyed. The screen
 * calls [set] and [clear] (through [BackByControl]); the alert's two buttons reach the service, which
 * calls [imBack] and [later]. Nothing else drives it.
 *
 * ## What a tick does
 *
 * With a time set: if the walker has arrived, the reminder ends; else, at or past the time and not
 * yet alerted for it, one alert ([AlertKind.BACK_BY], overriding silence like the sunset alert).
 * Every tick republishes [shown] with the clock, so the strip's last-hour window opens on time.
 *
 * ## How it ends: only by the walker's choice (Amendment 1)
 *
 * "I'm back" on the alert ([imBack]), "Clear" in the menu ([clear]), stopping the recording ([end]),
 * or **arrival after Return**: the sundown alerts' rule exactly ([SundownWatch]'s arrival check) —
 * Return tapped, a fresh GPS fix ([fixFreshness] not LOST, provider GPS), within [hasArrived] of the
 * start (the origin waypoint, or the track's first point before there is one). No "back at the car"
 * is inferred without Return: at the start of a recording the walker is already at the start, and a
 * loop past the car would cancel a safety reminder by mistake (the owner: no inferred rule). Unlike
 * the sundown watch, arrival is checked whether or not the sundown alerts are switched on: it belongs
 * to this reminder, not to that setting.
 *
 * ## A set before the service has begun
 *
 * The service begins a moment after Record. A Back by set inside that moment is kept if [begin] then
 * names the same track, as [ReturnWatch] keeps an early Return; another track drops it. Once begun
 * for one track, calls naming another are refused.
 *
 * ## What it keeps
 *
 * The time, the time it last alerted for, and the newest GPS fix, in memory, for one recording. Not in
 * DataStore: a process death ends the recording (a sticky restart arrives with no intent and records
 * nothing; `EndAbandonedTracksUseCase`), so a stored time would have nothing to drive it. Reported
 * to the owner as a gap shared with the sundown alerts (the -645 verify report, item 6).
 *
 * ## Threads
 *
 * As [SundownWatch]: fields under [lock], ticks serialised by [tickMutex], delivery outside [lock].
