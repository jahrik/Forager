/*
 * Motion Part 3, item 2 (dispatch 2026-09-28-676; the owner, RECORD -651: Lists "Slide and close up (Recommended)": "Removed rows
 * fade and shrink, the rest glide up, Undo reverses, and new or reordered rows glide into place").
 *
 * **How a removed row stays to leave.** A list here draws whatever its caller's list holds, so a deleted row is simply absent from
 * the next one. [rememberListRows] keeps each row that has gone missing in the list it hands back, where it was, marked as leaving,
 * until its exit has played ([ListRowMotion] fades and shrinks it); the rows below close up as its height goes, which is the glide
 * up. If the row comes back while it is leaving (Undo), it is the same row turned round: it grows back from where it had got to.
 * A row new to the list fades in and grows, pushing the rest down. A lazy list adds its own placement glide on top
 * (`Modifier.animateItem` at the call site, on [MotionTokens.listRowSpec]) so a row that moves to a new place glides there.
 *
 * **What it never animates.** The first rows a list shows (a list opening, or loading into an empty screen), and every change after
 * [resetKey] changes (the caller's way to say "this is a different list now", such as a different filter): those appear at once,
 * as before. Under reduced motion ([LocalReduceMotion]) nothing is kept and nothing grows: rows come and go at once.
 *
 * **A leaving row takes no touch** ([leavingTakesNoTouches]) and is gone from the semantics tree but for its marker, from its first
 * leaving frame, so a tap on it reaches nothing and a screen reader does not find a row that is no longer in the list. A swipe row
 * that leaves is wrapped, not changed: its own drag and its snap shut are exactly as before.
