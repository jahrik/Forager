/*
 * Motion Part 2, items 1 and 2 (dispatch 2026-09-28-666; the owner, RECORD -651: tabs "Quick crossfade", bottom bar "Fade with
 * the tab": "Solid to 80% and back fades in time with the tab change").
 *
 * **What has to hold while two tabs are on screen at once.** A crossfade keeps the outgoing tab composed for the length of the
 * fade, and the Maps tab hosts the live map, which nothing may re-measure (AvailabilityCompactScaffold's comments on the map's
 * measured height). Two things would re-measure it: the bottom bar appearing as the Maps tab leaves (the content area gets
 * shorter by the bar's height), and in landscape the rail beside the content appearing (narrower). So the outgoing tab is held
 * ([holdWhileLeaving]) at the size it had, and where it was on screen, until it has gone: it is not measured again with the new
 * room. And from its first leaving frame it takes no touch ([leavingTakesNoTouches]), so a touch on bare background of the
 * incoming tab cannot reach a map that is fading away beneath it.
 *
 * **Not verified anywhere** (nothing in this change has been compiled): what a SurfaceView-backed MapLibre map looks like under a
 * Compose alpha fade. Its surface is composited by the system, not drawn by Compose, so the fade may not apply to it (inferred
 * from how SurfaceView works, not observed). That, and the cost of keeping a second map alive for the fade, are the S22's.
