/**
 * The Seasonal tab: the [ConditionsCard] weather panel (current conditions plus today's forecast),
 * above a test of [FruitingPatternAssumptions.FRUITING_LAG_DAYS] — the 7–21 day rain-to-fruiting-lag
 * rule of thumb [TripWindowsCard] and [ForagingWeatherGuidanceSection] already state as unmeasured
 * field lore — against real historical iNaturalist sightings and real historical Open-Meteo
 * rainfall for the current search.
 *
 * The two sit in one destination per PANEL-CONTENTS-DISPATCH.md item 2: Seasonal and weather are
 * both pre-trip checks (Seasonal rare, weather per-trip), so consolidating them puts everything
 * checked before leaving in one place. The weather panel is listed first — it's the more frequently
 * consulted of the two — and does not gate on or wait for the fruiting-lag fetch below it: they are
 * fetched independently (see [AvailabilityViewModel.refresh] for the conditions/forecast fetch,
 * [AvailabilityViewModel.onSeasonalTabSelected] for the lazily-fetched fruiting-lag pattern below).
 *
 * **The fruiting-lag section does not feed [AvailabilityEntry.relativeLikelihood] or the ranked
 * List tab.** It answers one narrow question — does the data support this one named lag range —
 * and nothing here changes how species are ranked. See [FruitingLagDistribution]'s own doc comment.
