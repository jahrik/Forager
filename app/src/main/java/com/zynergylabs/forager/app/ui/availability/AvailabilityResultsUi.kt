package com.zynergylabs.forager.app.ui.availability

// Split-AvailabilityScreen Stage D: list, seasonal and results, moved verbatim out of
// AvailabilityScreen.kt. Two blocks that were not adjacent there — lines 2928-3276 (ListTab,
// OfflineResultsBanner, ResultsSection, SeasonalTab, READABLE_CONTENT_MAX_WIDTH,
// SEASONAL_CONTENT_TAG, SeasonalPatternContent, SeasonalSampleSizeSummary, FruitingLagChart,
// FruitingLagBucketCounts) and the file's tail, lines 5824-6074 (ConditionsCard,
// TRIP_WINDOW_DATE_FORMAT, TripWindowsCard, TripWindowReportContent, TripWindowRow,
// ForagingWeatherGuidanceSection, SpeciesRow). The tail block belongs with the first because
// ListTab and ResultsSection compose those cards; that is not obvious from position alone, so
// it is said here. Same package as Stages A and C, for the same reason: the tests reach this set
// only by its tags (SEASONAL_CONTENT_TAG, "species-row") and AvailabilityPureFunctions.kt's use
// of TRIP_WINDOW_DATE_FORMAT resolves unchanged. Pure move: no signature, name or body changed.
// Three composables went private -> internal because their callers stay in AvailabilityScreen.kt
// (ListTab, called by the compact scaffold; SeasonalTab, two scaffold
// call sites; TripWindowsCard, called by TripPlannerSection). No symbol left behind is reached
// from here.
//
// Data part C (dispatch -668, RECORD -655's "Piece by piece"): the Seasonal tab (SeasonalTab through
// ConditionsCard) now lives in AvailabilitySeasonalUi.kt and the trip windows card (TRIP_WINDOW_DATE_FORMAT
// through ForagingWeatherGuidanceSection) in AvailabilityTripWindowsUi.kt; this file keeps the List tab.

/**
 * The ranked list.
 *
 * The Current Conditions/forecast weather panel used to sit here, above the list; it now lives in
 * the Seasonal tab instead — see [ConditionsCard] and [SeasonalTab]'s own doc comment for why
 * (PANEL-CONTENTS-DISPATCH.md item 2: Seasonal and weather are both pre-trip checks, so they were
 * consolidated into one destination).
 *
 * Trip windows are shown in the drawer's Trip Planner section — see [TripPlannerSection] — because
 * "what's likely nearby this month" and "when in the next few days is worth going" are different
 * questions with different lifetimes (the ranking depends on the browsed month, trip windows only
 * on the next several days), and fusing them into one scrolling column was one more step to reach
 * whichever one wasn't currently showing.
