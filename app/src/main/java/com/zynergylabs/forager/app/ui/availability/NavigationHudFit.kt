/**
 * T11 fixes (dispatch 2026-10-09-02, RECORD -766): what the navigation display drops, and in what order, when its text does
 * not fit. The owner chose "Distance first, short status (Recommended)", option A of P1 and P2 in
 * `docs/navigation/2026-10-09-t11-hud-landscape-check.md`. The order and the short strings below were proposed by the coder and
 * confirmed by the owner (RECORD -768: "Yes, use these (Recommended)"; the evening line and "No route": "Yes (Recommended)").
 * The pure half: every choice here is a function of measured widths,
 * so a wrong order is a pinned-literal test failure (`NavigationHudFitTest`), not a visual one.
 *
 * What is kept longest, first to last:
 * 1. the distance figure, never cut while a shorter form or a lower item can give way;
 * 2. the needle, never removed (it is an icon beside the turn words, and the words give way, not it);
 * 3. the fix-age warning, lost or stale, in its short form if it must ("45 s old", "No fix 6 min");
 * 4. what the figure measures, "by trail" or "straight" (beside the figure, or leading the status line, RECORD -713);
 * 5. the turn words, which shrink to the bearing alone ("169°") and then go;
 * 6. "Approaching";
 * 7. the straight-line note on the way home ("≈ 1250 ft straight", then "≈ 1250 ft").
 *
 * A status line with no empty form among its [NavigationHudReadout.statusForms] (a warning, or a message such as "No
 * location") is never dropped: it is shortened, the "By trail ·" lead goes before it, and only then does "…" cut it.
