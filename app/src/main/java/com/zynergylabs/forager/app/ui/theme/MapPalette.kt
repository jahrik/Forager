/**
 * The colours the map overlay draws its markers with, as `android.graphics` ARGB ints, in a day and a
 * night variant. `SightingsMap.kt` reads [forMode] for the Night Maps toggle, on every basemap,
 * Satellite included: over Satellite the basemap stays day and only the markers switch (owner ruling,
 * colour build C2).
 *
 * ## One role per marker
 *
 * Each marker kind has its own role, so no two kinds share a colour: [waypoint], [find], [plannedTrip],
 * [photo], [keptTrack], [breadcrumb], the centre-pin picker's [centrePin], [searchCentre],
 * [offlineRegion] and [sightingDot], plus the two rings drawn on the sighting dot
 * ([sightingDotStroke], [sightingDotStrokeSelected]) and the [casing] every other marker is outlined
 * in. Before C2 the find pin shared the offline region's colour and the photo marker the planned
 * trip's; colour told them apart only by shape, and in the find pin's case not even that.
 *
 * ## Hand-authored, not derived
 *
 * Every value here is chosen, not computed from a colour scheme. The user-mark and system-mark colours
 * are the owner's picks from the swatch board (`docs/audits/2026-09-27-marker-swatch-board.md`: every
 * row's rank-1 candidate), searched there against the measured ground of both basemaps in both modes,
 * with night measured on the V1 night transform. Three are owner overrides rather than board
 * candidates: the sighting ring stays white and the selected ring stays `#2196F3`, in both modes; the
 * sighting dot is near black by day and a muted grey at night, and those exact greys are the planner's
 * picks. `MapPaletteTest` pins every role's measured figures against that ground as ratchets.
 *
 * MapLibre renders on a native canvas and cannot read a Compose `ColorScheme`, so `SightingsMap` takes
 * ints. They live here rather than beside the layer code so that a palette change is made in one place.
 *
 * ## Why this is keyed on a map mode, not on the app theme
 *
 * An earlier revision derived these from the ambient `ColorScheme`, so the map followed the device's
 * light/dark setting. That was built, measured and abandoned, because the basemap is raster and does
 * not follow the device theme: varying the marks by theme moved the mark without moving the ground.
 * Night Maps is a property of the map, and since colour build C1 it moves the ground too (the V1
 * inversion, `BasemapStyles.kt`'s `NIGHT_RASTER_PAINT`), which is what makes a night palette
 * meaningful.
 *
 * ## History
 *
 * The palette before C2 went through five night passes (a dimmed ground, warm-shifted marks, then two
 * shared colours with night-only icon shapes) and was then held day-only on the owner's instruction.
 * Those values and the reasoning for each pass are in this file's git history, and the removed
 * night-only icon path in `docs/plans/contrast_assertions.md`. None of it describes the palette now.
