 * but its store never has data for them, so they are hidden in every state a map is given
 * (`withUnavailableColourFieldsHidden`) and never offered, drawn or credited.
 *
 * Within each group the order is the one `SightingsMap` drew before L0a, and the reasons recorded
 * there still hold: the offline region's fill is lowest, so a coverage circle never covers a
 * marker; each casing is directly below its own track; planned trips, then waypoints, then finds
 * and photos, so a pin never sits under a sibling marker at the same point.
 *
 * **One visible change, accepted by the owner** (ruling 1 on `prompts/preserved/2026-09-27-30.md`,
 * "Accept: markers above lines"): the search centre and the sighting dots used to be added between
 * the offline outline and the breadcrumb casing, so every track line drew over them. As markers
 * they now draw above every line, the convention point markers follow elsewhere, and the order a
 * finger wins in ([tapWinner]) is now the order things are drawn in.
 *
 * `userToggleable` follows the owner's overlay list for the Layers sheet (layer ruling 3: finds,
 * waypoints, tracks, planned trips, offline maps, journal entries); photos are counted with finds as
 * part of an entry.
 *
 * **J8's five journal-entry halos** (`prompts/preserved/2026-09-28-52.md`, J8-2) each sit below the
 * record layer they decorate, so the halo shows as a ring around the record's own outline. The two line
 * halos sit directly below their record's casing: the offline region's under its outline's border, the
 * kept tracks' under their casing, both in the lines band. The three marker rings (waypoints, finds,
 * photos) are the decorations band, below every line (J8 follow-ups, continuation `2026-09-28-87`, item 4;
 * the owner, "1 A", to "Move marker rings below all lines"; the band itself from dispatch `2026-09-28-100`,
 * the owner, "Option C"), so a ring never covers a track, the offline outline or any other line. They were
 * at the bottom of the lines band first, and the band put them exactly where they already drew. J8 had
 * put each directly under its own marker, above every line and the search-centre
 * reticle, and continuation `-87` reports rings covering parts of a kept track and of the reticle. A
 * halo takes no taps, so M1's tap
 * routing is unchanged, and it is drawn only while its record's own switch and the "Journal entries"
 * switch are both on ([MapLayerSpec.drawnWith]). The sighting dots and the search centre are not in that list, so they are not
 * toggleable here. `userOpacity` is offered for colour fields only (layer ruling 1: "each with its
 * own opacity slider"); the multiplier itself applies to any layer. Both are for L0b to confirm.
 *
 * **The offline outline's border** (`prompts/preserved/2026-09-28-79.md`; owner: "The outline should
 * have a white border", "Yes the night outline only") sits directly below the outline, as a casing sits
 * below its track, and follows the fill's switch like the outline. It takes no taps, so what a tap
 * reaches is unchanged. Its role is white at night and fully transparent by day, so by day it draws
 * nothing and only the night map changes.
