/**
 * Decodes a photo off app-private storage and renders it, filling [modifier]'s given size either
 * way — or a plain placeholder box if decoding fails (a missing file, a corrupt image, an I/O
 * error). Workstream G2 (`docs/plans/pr26-rework.md`): this is the single decode-and-render
 * implementation `LogEntryDetailScreen`'s `LogPhotoThumbnail`, `LogGalleryScreen`'s
 * (former) `GalleryCoverThumbnail`, and `LogEntryReportScreen`'s `ReportPhotoThumbnail` each
 * hand-rolled separately before this — one of them cross-referenced the other two in its own doc
 * comment as "same decode pattern," confirming the duplication was known, not accidental drift.
 * Deliberately just the decode-and-render piece, not a full tile: every prior call site wraps this
 * in its own outer `Box` for sizing (a fixed-dp square, or `fillMaxSize` inside an
 * already-sized parent) and, in [LogPhotoThumbnail]'s case, an overlaid remove button — none of
 * that belongs inside a component meant to be reused by call sites with different chrome around
 * the same underlying photo. This shape is also why G3 can add a selection affordance later (a
 * checkmark overlay, a clickable modifier) by wrapping this in its own `Box`, without touching
 * decoding itself — the dispatch's own requirement that this stay extensible without gaining
 * selection now.
 *
 * A decode failure is logged, never silently swallowed the way all three predecessors did — via
 * raw [Log.w], the same choice [MushroomLogViewModel] already made deliberately for this feature
 * area, not the DI'd `ErrorLog` seam [AvailabilityViewModel]/`TrackRecordingViewModel` use
 * elsewhere: this is a `@Composable`, not a ViewModel, so there's no constructor to inject a seam
 * into, and Robolectric's `ShadowLog` already lets a test assert on a raw `Log.w` call without one.
 *
 * **Callers must give it bounded size constraints** (`fillMaxSize`, `size`, or a width and a
 * height). Until the photo loads this draws the same `Image` with a flat-colour painter so that a
 * caller's click stays on one layout node (see the comment at the `Image`), and an `Image` whose
 * painter has no intrinsic size fills whatever bounded space it is given, where the old placeholder
 * `Box` wrapped to nothing. Every call site in `main/` already bounds it; an unsized call would show
 * a placeholder that fills its parent and then jumps to the photo's size.
 *
 * **Decoded to the cell it is shown in** (dispatch 2026-09-28-658; the owner: "Thumbnails are sized
 * to the screen they're shown on"). The photo is decoded once its laid-out size is known, through
 * [decodeThumbnail], at the coarsest sampling that still covers that size, never past the viewer's
 * own [VIEWER_MAX_EDGE_PX]. Until then, and for a size of zero, nothing is decoded and the
 * placeholder shows. Decoded once per photo, at the first size it is laid out at. This replaced a fixed `inSampleSize` of 4 whatever the source: a 12 MP photo
 * then decoded at 1008×756 for a 40 dp row icon, and a large import at many megabytes per cell.
 * Imported photos keep their files and go through the same decode.
