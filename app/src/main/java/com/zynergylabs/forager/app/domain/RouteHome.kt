/**
 * The way home along the walked route: where the needle aims, and how far it is, or why there is
 * no route to show. Pure; the caller holds the hop band between calls, as [pathHome]'s callers do.
 *
 * ## The route
 *
 * The track as stored, joined to itself wherever it passes within [SELF_JOIN_EPSILON_METERS] of
 * itself, walked by the shortest route from the most recent stored point back to the first
 * ([joinedTrackRoute], the same search [pathHome]'s distance comes from), and then to the origin
 * waypoint when there is one. Decision D1: the needle aims at a point along this route, never at
 * the destination directly and never off the path. Decision D2: this is for the return to the
 * start only.
 *
 * Because the track goes on recording during the return, a detour the walker makes is recorded
 * and becomes part of the route home.
 *
 * ## Where the walker is on it
 *
 * As [pathHome] has it, at the **most recent stored point**, never projected onto the nearest
 * part of the track (owner ruling; [pathHome]'s "Where the walker is on the track"). The hop is
 * the straight line from the walker's fix to that point, banded with [nextHopBand], and
 * [HopBand.FAR] withholds the route.
 *
 * ## The lookahead: (hop + 25 m) along the route (the planner's ruling, option B)
 *
 * The stored track lags the walker. The service writes points every 30 s or every 20 kept points,
 * and the screen re-reads the track every 15 s, so the most recent stored point can be 30 to 45 s
 * behind the walker: at walking pace, 27 to 40 m, more than the lookahead itself. Measured from
 * that point alone, the lookahead would often land behind a walker heading home. The walker has
 * covered at least the straight-line hop of route since the stored point, so the lookahead is
 * measured from there: the first route point at least `hop + [ROUTE_LOOKAHEAD_METERS]` along the
 * route from the most recent stored point, or the route's end when the route is shorter.
 *
 * **Where it still lands behind, said plainly:** when the route winds hard inside the lag (the
 * walker has walked round a bend since the last stored point, so the straight-line hop is much
 * shorter than the route they covered), `hop + 25 m` is still behind them. `RouteHomeTest` shows
 * the case. It is left as the ruling chose it; the lag behind it is the service's batching.
 *
 * ## The corner guard (a second role for the self-join ε)
 *
 * The lookahead stops at the last route point for which **every route point from the walker's
 * assumed place (`hop` metres along) up to it** lies within [SELF_JOIN_EPSILON_METERS] of the
 * straight line from the walker. This is the 10 m self-join ruling reused in a second role, not a
 * separate decision: that ruling accepts crossing up to ε of ground the walker has not walked, and
 * no more, so the needle's line may stray from the walked route by up to ε and no more.
 * **Provisional, with the 25 m.** It keeps the needle from aiming across the inside of a bend,
 * which is the failure the decision record names as the one that costs something on a forest path.
 * As first worded it read from the most recent stored point, which pulled the lookahead back
 * behind the walker whenever the hop passed 10 m; the planner corrected it to read from the
 * walker's assumed place.
 *
 * **What that does to a walker beside the route, said plainly:** the rule assumes the walker is
 * `hop` metres along the route, not beside it. A walker standing 30 m to the side of the last
 * stored point is pointed about 45 m up the path. Also shown in `RouteHomeTest`, and also to be
 * checked on a walk.
 *
 * ## The distance
 *
 * [PathHome.totalMeters] for the same inputs, built from the same route search, so the HUD's
 * route figure and today's path-home figure cannot differ.
 *
 * ## Who calls it, and how often
 *
 * `TrackRecordingViewModel`'s route tick (dispatch 2026-09-28-423, plan task T6), every 5 s while
 * returning (decision D4), fed the track its 15 s poll last read, the last accuracy-gated fix and
 * the origin waypoint. That tick is also where the ViewModel's path-home figure now comes from,
 * [RouteHome.Ahead.pathHome], so there is one route search per tick and none in the poll.
