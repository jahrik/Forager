 * message 3 on dispatch 2026-09-28-03: an explicit operating limit, CLAUDE.md). Chosen so the count of
 * blocks one camera idle asks for stays bounded: at zoom 7 a map sees 360 / (512 * 2^7) = 0.0055 degree
 * per dp, so even a 1280 by 800 dp window (larger than any map pane this app lays out) spans 7.03 by
 * 4.39 degrees at the equator, where a Mercator view spans the most latitude, and touches at most 9 by 6
 * = **54 blocks** (5,400 cells a layer) however it is placed (`ForecastCellLayerTest`). A phone in
 * portrait at zoom 7 sees about 2 by 4.5 degrees. No new copy: the legend still shows while a field is
 * on, and the field is simply empty until the user zooms in.
