/**
 * What [ReturnWatch] tells a screen. [trackId] is the recording it is for, or `null` when it is
 * for none. A screen copies [isReturning] and [isOffTrack] only when [trackId] is the track it is
 * itself recording; see `TrackRecordingViewModel`.
 *
 * [isBegun] is **the live answer to "is a recording running"** (dispatch 2026-09-28-400, Amendment
 * 3): true only between the recording service's `begin` and `end`. An open track row is not that
 * answer, because a killed process leaves the same row. A screen opened while this is true takes
 * the recording up, in [mode], the mode the service is recording in. A [trackId] with [isBegun]
 * false is a Return accepted early, before the service has begun, and is not a recording.
 *
 * [returnToStart] is the watch's own measurement, the one the decision was made on. The screen's
 * button shows a distance the ViewModel works out for itself from its own fixes (dispatch
 * 2026-09-28-400, Amendment 2, the planner's ruling on question 1), so nothing under `ui/` reads
 * this field today. It is here because the decision cannot be checked without it.

/**
 * Watches a walker on the way back to a recording's start, and delivers the off-track alert.
 *
 * It owns what used to be `TrackRecordingViewModel`'s: the returning flag, the start point and
 * the one [AlertDelivery.deliver] call. The decision is [OffTrackJudge]'s (dispatch 2026-09-28-425,
 * plan task T21): the distance from the path walked out, not, as before, three readings' distance
 * to the start rising. The distance to the start ([ComputeReturnToStartUseCase]) is still measured
 * and published, for nothing but [ReturnWatchState.returnToStart].
 *
 * ## Why it exists (dispatch 2026-09-28-400, Amendment 2; the owner chose "Option B")
 *
 * While all of that was the ViewModel's, it died with the Activity. A recording swiped away from
 * recents went on being recorded by `TrackRecordingService`, and nothing would say "Off track"
 * again for it (see [AlertDelivery]'s header, which named the hole). This object is held by
 * `AppContainer`, for the life of the process, and driven by the service, which is the thing that
 * keeps the process alive and has the continuous stream of fixes. The ViewModel calls it for
 * Return and copies its state. Clearing the ViewModel no longer touches the decision.
 *
 * ## Who calls what
 *
 * - **The recording service** calls [begin] when a recording starts, [onFix] for **every raw fix**
 *   its collector receives, [onKeptPoint] for every point its sampler keeps for the track, and
 *   [end] when the recording stops or the service is destroyed. Nothing else begins it, and nothing
 *   else feeds it.
 * - **The ViewModel** calls [startReturn] and [stopReturn] from the screen's Return control, and
 *   [setStartPoint] whenever the start point it shows changes. It collects [state].
 *
 * **Two streams, two uses.** The kept points ([onKeptPoint]) are the track as it is stored, and the
 * ones kept before Return, behind the start point, are the path a return is measured against: the
 * track as it stood when Return was tapped, with its not-yet-written tail, so not read back from the
 * store, which lags by up to 30 s. The raw fixes ([onFix]), about one a second, are the readings the
 * path is measured from; [OffTrackJudge] skips the network ones itself.
 *
 * ## A return asked for before the service has begun
 *
 * The service begins a moment after the Record tap: the ViewModel creates the track row,
 * `MainActivity` sends the start, the service handles it. A Return tapped inside that moment must
 * not be lost (Amendment 2, ruling 3). So [startReturn] and [setStartPoint] are accepted for a
 * track before [begin], and kept if [begin] then names the same track. If it names another, they
 * are dropped. Once begun for one track, calls that name another are refused.
 *
 * ## Two callers at once
 *
 * The service's collector runs on a background thread and the ViewModel on the main thread, so
 * unlike the ViewModel's version this has two writers. Everything the object holds is read and
 * written inside one lock, the judge's reading included, so two fixes arriving together cannot
 * both decide to alert. [state] is a
 * `StateFlow`, which is safe to read from any thread. [AlertDelivery.deliver] is called after the
 * lock is released: it posts a notification and vibrates, and nothing here should wait on that.
 *
 * ## What it keeps
 *
 * The kept points of the recording it is begun for, which are the stored track: a few thousand at
 * the four-hour cap. A return snapshots them; a new recording, or the end of this one, drops them.
 *
 * ## Left able to take the sundown alerts, which are not built
 *
 * The two sundown alerts (plan task T2) need the same things this has: a holder that outlives the
 * Activity, the service's lifetime, and [AlertDelivery]. Nothing for them is built here.
