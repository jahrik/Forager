/**
 * Delivers a recording's three sundown alerts: the heads-up, the leave-by and the sunset alert
 * (dispatch 2026-09-28-516, plan tasks T2 and T13, the owner's choices in RECORD -513 to -515).
 *
 * ## Why it lives here, and who drives it
 *
 * The countdown on screen rides `TrackRecordingViewModel`'s scope, which dies when the app is
 * swiped away. This is held by `AppContainer` for the life of the process, as [ReturnWatch] is,
 * and driven by `TrackRecordingService`, which is what keeps the process alive while recording:
 * [begin] when a recording starts, [onFix] for every raw fix its collector receives, [tick] on its
 * own timer (and once at the first position), [end] when the recording stops or the service is
 * destroyed. Nothing else drives it.
 *
 * ## What the screen reads from it ([shown], dispatch 2026-09-28-592, Amendment 1, RECORD -593)
 *
 * The sundown line on the map's strip and the navigation display (plan task T3) is published here,
 * as [shown], from the same tick that decides the alerts, so its "start back by" is the leave-by
 * alert's own time ([sundownLeaveByAt]) and never a second computation of it. The service and the
 * screen share this process (the service declares no `android:process`), so the recording ViewModel
 * collects it as it collects [ReturnWatch]'s state. The owner, allowing it: "Yes, allow it
 * (Recommended)". To that end every tick with a position computes and publishes the line, and the
 * two checks that used to end a tick first, the alerts turned off and arrival, now sit just before
 * deciding and delivering: the line stays with the alerts off (the switch "gates the notifications
 * only") and after arrival. **Every alert still fires at the moment it did** (the owner's
 * condition, `SundownWatchAlertMomentsTest`, written and run against `main` first): what the
 * decision remembers (the fired set, the held sunset, the hop band) is still written only when the
 * alerts are on and the walker has not arrived, and arrival is still only noticed with the alerts
 * on. A margin changed in Settings re-derives the line at once ([onMarginChanged]) from the last
 * tick's sunset and walk back, through the same function, and never decides or delivers anything;
 * the next tick reads the new margin for the alerts as before.
 *
 * ## What each tick works out
 *
 * - **Sunset**, from the newest fix of **any** kind, GPS or network. The owner, 2026-10-04:
 *   "Sunset moves about 4 s per km, and GPS-only would mean no sundown alert at all under canopy
 *   or indoors." An owner-approved exception to -510's rule that an approximate position never
 *   decides anything, for the sunset time only. With no live fix yet, the platform's last known
 *   position ([LastKnownLocationSource], -510's, reused) stands in, for the sunset only: a
 *   recording with no live reading at all still gets a sunset time and its alerts (the owner's
 *   condition for merging this, with -510 merged first).
 * - **The walk back**, from [returnWalkingTime] over the stored track (read through the read seam,
 *   so the network-fix exclusion and its counts are the ones the estimate's "at least" rules
 *   expect), its origin waypoint, and the newest **GPS** fix only. GPS is told from network by the
 *   provider the platform reported, passed beside each fix by the service ([FixProvider], dispatch
 *   2026-09-28-527); an unknown provider is not GPS. Until -527 the raw stream carried no provider
 *   and this used the timestamp rule ([isNetworkProviderFix]), which on the S22's walks disagreed with
 *   the provider 4 times in 1,969 fixes. Its freshness is [fixFreshness]
 *   of its age, so a GPS fix older than five minutes withholds the estimate. The hop band is
 *   carried between ticks, as [returnWalkingTime] asks.
 * - **The decision**, [DecideSundownAlertUseCase], with what has already fired.
 *
 * **Failure direction** (recorded in -516's report against RECORD -519, and still the direction): a
 * phone whose live fixes come only from network, or from a provider this app does not recognise, has
 * no GPS fix, so the walk back reads "unknown" and the leave-by time falls back to sunset minus the
 * margin. Safe in direction: no confident figure it does not have. The timestamp rule's own failure,
 * a phone whose GPS stamps milliseconds, no longer reaches this watch (dispatch 2026-09-28-527).
 *
 * **The sunset held.** [ComputeSundownCountdownUseCase] always reports the *next* sunset, so
 * at sunset it reports tomorrow's (and its search turns over a fraction of a second early). The
 * watch keeps the sunset it has been counting toward and refuses a jump to the next day, which is
 * what lets the sunset alert fire at all. A recording started after sunset
 * counts toward tomorrow's and alerts on nothing tonight: the night foray the owner described.
 *
 * ## When nothing more fires
 *
 * Once per recording each. After [end]. With the alerts turned off
 * ([SundownPreferencesRepository.getAlertsEnabled]). And, the owner's option B, once the walker
 * is heading back (Return tapped) and a fresh GPS fix is within [hasArrived]'s reach of the start
 * (the origin waypoint, or the track's first point before there is one): from then on the
 * recording is over as far as these alerts are concerned, even if the walker sets out again.
 * Without Return, only stopping the recording silences them.
 *
 * ## What it keeps, and for how long
 *
 * The fired set, the hop band, the two newest fixes and the arrived flag, for one recording, in
 * memory. Not in DataStore: a process death ends the recording too (a sticky restart arrives with
 * no intent and records nothing), so there is nothing to carry across one.
 *
 * ## Threads
 *
 * [onFix] is called from the service's collector and [tick] from its timer, on different
 * coroutines. The fields are read and written under [lock]; ticks are serialised by [tickMutex],
 * so two cannot decide the same alert. [AlertDelivery] is called outside [lock].
