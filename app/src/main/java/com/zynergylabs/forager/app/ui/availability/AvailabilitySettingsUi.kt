// Split-AvailabilityScreen Stage F: the drawer rows, settings and compact tools drawer, moved
// verbatim out of AvailabilityScreen.kt. Two blocks, lines of the file as of 3bd0efe: 2493-2956
// (BuildIdentityFooter, DrawerHeader, MushroomLogEntryRow, SettingsEntryRow, PhotoGalleryEntryRow,
// SettingsHeader, PhotoGalleryHeader, CompactSettingsTab, SettingsContent, ThemeModeSection,
// NightModeMapsSection, PhotoLocationSection, CameraPortraitLockSection, LOCK_CAMERA_SETTING_LABEL,
// LOCK_CAMERA_SETTING_EXPLANATION, PHOTO_LOCATION_SETTING_LABEL,
// PHOTO_LOCATION_SETTING_EXPLANATION, DistanceUnitSection) and 2990-3074
// (CompactToolsDrawerContent). Same package as Stages A to E, so every same-package reference
// resolves unchanged. Pure move: no signature, name or body changed. Nine widenings, private ->
// internal: BuildIdentityFooter, DrawerHeader, MushroomLogEntryRow, SettingsEntryRow,
// PhotoGalleryEntryRow, SettingsHeader, PhotoGalleryHeader, SettingsContent and
// CompactToolsDrawerContent, whose callers stay in AvailabilityScreen.kt. No symbol left behind is
// reached from here. Seam F (the wide layout) was released by the owner for this split, as recorded
// in the Understory amendment merged in #130.
//
// J6 (2026-09-29): PhotoGalleryEntryRow and PhotoGalleryHeader, two of the rows moved here, were removed
// with the standalone Photo Gallery panel (the owner's ruling 2, 2026-09-28: "the old Photo Gallery panel
// is removed. Only the album remains, as on the phone"), and the list above records the move as it was.
//
// Dispatch 2026-09-28-707: PhotoLocationSection and CameraPortraitLockSection, two more of the moved names, were removed when
// the two camera settings moved into the camera's gear panel (ui/log/CameraSettingsPanel.kt); the list above is still history.

 * same height as this row, so the row's position alone reads as "tap here to undo what the tune
 * icon did" without needing its own marker — an X here was one more thing competing for attention

/**
 * The compact "Tools" drawer's entire content. Named for what it actually holds, not what it used
 * to: the composable itself and this file's own doc comments called it the "search drawer" through
 * two rounds of the map/navigation redesign — first because "the whole side panel is the search
 * feature" (the project owner's own original framing, when species search and Recent Searches both
 * lived here), then again once dispatch C moved both out into [SearchDropdown] over the map (see
 * that composable's own doc comment). The owner's own later call, on seeing that move land: stop
 * calling this the search drawer at all, "so it doesn't get lumped together in the future by some
 * ambitious planner" — species search is gone from here for good, and the name should say so. Two
 * things live here now, none of them search:
 *
 * 1. **[SearchControls]** — Trip Planner only. Waypoints moved
 *    out (Journal restructure Stage 1) into the Journal's own Records tab. Since dispatch
 *    2026-09-28-707 the **Sundown** section ([ToolsSundownSection]) sits under it, in the same
 *    scroll, moved here from Settings so it is one tap away instead of two.
 * 2. **Settings** ([showSettings]) — new as of the map redesign's Dispatch B, per the owner's own
 *    call: this drawer *is* the Tools destination now, so Settings (which had its own bottom-nav
 *    tab before that dispatch) lives here instead, reached one tap deeper via its own entry row —
 *    the same "drill in, own back step" shape [CompactSettingsTab] already uses for its own
 *    CrashLogs submenu.
 *
 * [DrawerHeader] stays the one visible way to close this drawer, same as before. **No sticky Log
 * row** — that stayed on the bottom nav (Journal) — but Settings is sticky here again.
