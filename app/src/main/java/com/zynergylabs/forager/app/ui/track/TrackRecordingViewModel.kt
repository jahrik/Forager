/**
 * Owns track-recording and waypoint UI state — kept in its own package/ViewModel rather than
 * folded into [com.zynergylabs.forager.app.ui.availability.AvailabilityViewModel], the same reasoning
 * `LogPanel`'s doc comment gives for the mushroom log's own `MushroomLogViewModel`. Unlike the log,
 * this doesn't get a separate screen: breadcrumbs and waypoint markers are overlays on the same map
 * [com.zynergylabs.forager.app.ui.availability.AvailabilityScreen] already renders, threaded in as state the
 * same way `compassProvider`/`locateMeStatus` already are — a genuinely separate *ViewModel*, not a
 * separate *destination*.
 *
 * ## Why breadcrumbs are polled, not reactive
 *
 * [TrackRepository] is plain suspend calls, matching every other Room-backed repository in this
 * app — there is no `Flow<Track>` to collect. [com.zynergylabs.forager.app.service.TrackRecordingService]
 * itself batches writes (every 20 points or 30 seconds, whichever first) rather than writing per
 * fix, so polling at roughly that same cadence ([POLL_INTERVAL_MILLIS]) shows breadcrumbs about as
 * fresh as the data actually is, without adding a reactive-query layer this database has never
 * needed anywhere else.
 *
 * ## What this does not handle
 *
 * A track left recording when the app process dies (OS kills it, not a user-initiated stop) is not
 * resumed here — [activeTrack][TrackRecordingUiState.activeTrack] is in-memory ViewModel state, lost
 * on process death same as the rest of this screen's state, while the foreground service and its
 * Room row survive independently. That leaves a track with `endedAt == null` and no UI pointing at
 * it — the "resumable/closeable state" [com.zynergylabs.forager.app.service.TrackRecordingService]'s own doc
 * comment already flags as the UI's responsibility, deliberately not built here to keep this pass
 * scoped to starting, stopping, and showing a recording that's actually running.
 *
 * **One case of that is now handled (dispatch 2026-09-28-400, Amendment 3):** when the Activity is
 * destroyed but the process and the service live on (the app swiped away from recents), a new
 * ViewModel takes the running recording up; see [takeUpRunningRecording]. A process that died is
 * still not resumed, and the open row it leaves is still not treated as a recording.
 *
 * ## Why return-to-start is fed by [locationTracker], not a one-shot fetch
 *
 * The first pass of the return-to-vehicle screen recomputed [ReturnToStartInfo] from
 * `AvailabilityViewModel`'s `locateMeStatus` — a one-shot "where am I right now" fetch, refreshed
 * only when the user taps the locate-me icon. That made the bearing/distance shown stale between
 * taps. This ViewModel now collects [LocationTracker.fixes] itself, the same continuous stream
 * [com.zynergylabs.forager.app.service.TrackRecordingService] collects for the track's own points, whenever a
 * recording is active — so [TrackRecordingUiState.returnToStart] updates on every fix, not just on
 * demand. This does mean two independent OS location-listener
 * registrations while recording (the service's and this one) rather than one shared stream — a
 * real, accepted duplication, not a hidden one, in exchange for not re-plumbing the service to
 * publish its fixes back out to the UI layer for this one reader.
 *
 * ## The off-track decision is not here any more (dispatch 2026-09-28-400, Amendment 2)
 *
 * It was: the returning flag, the rolling window, the cooldown and the alert were this class's,
 * fed by the collection above, and all of it died when the app was swiped away. They are
 * [ReturnWatch]'s now, held by the app's container and fed by the recording service. This class
 * calls the watch from [startReturn] and [stopReturn], hands it the start point when that changes,
 * and copies two things from it into [TrackRecordingUiState]: [TrackRecordingUiState.isReturning]
 * and [TrackRecordingUiState.isOffTrack]. The distance on the Return button is still worked out
 * here ([returnToStart]), from this class's own fixes.
 *
 * So the same sum is done in two places, from the two listeners that already existed. They can
 * differ by one fix: the button's distance is from the last fix this class's listener received,
 * "off track now" from the last the service's received. On a phone both arrive about once a
 * second from the same source. Nothing on screen compares the two.

     * notification behind it. Resyncing here closes that, because backgrounding is the one thing
     * that reliably happens after a stop from the shade.
     *
     * **Why this and not the foreground gate `AvailabilityViewModel` uses.** That gate releases the
     * subscription on `ON_STOP` unconditionally, which is right there and would be a regression
     * here: two things in [beginLocationTracking]'s collector must keep running with the screen off
     * during a *legitimate* recording.
     *
     * 1. The origin waypoint. It is seeded from the first fix that clears the mode's accuracy gate,
     *    with no timeout, and [com.zynergylabs.forager.app.domain.pathHome]'s own doc records that under
     *    canopy that fix may arrive very late or never. A pocketed phone is the normal way to walk
     *    a track. Gate the collector off and a canopy recording acquires no origin at all, and the
     *    navigation HUD then has no target to point at — the return-to-vehicle safety feature.
     * 2. The off-track alert. [returnToStart] was fed from that collector and ran the decision.
     *    **No longer true since dispatch 2026-09-28-400, Amendment 2:** the decision is
     *    [ReturnWatch]'s and is fed by the recording service, so it does not depend on this
     *    collector at all. Reason 1 still stands on its own, so the collector is left as it was.
     *
     * So the collector stays bounded by the recording, as it always was. What changes is that
     * "the recording" now means the track's own row rather than a field nothing repopulates.
     *
     * **What this does not close, recorded rather than fixed.** During a legitimate recording,
     * backgrounding still does not release this ViewModel's subscription, and it is a *second*
     * platform registration on top of the service's own — `LocationTracker.fixes` is a cold
     * `callbackFlow`, so every collector runs `requestLocationUpdates` independently. Routing this
     * ViewModel off the service's fixes instead is the structural change and is out of this scope.

     *
     * **The defect this exists for.** `TrackRecordingService.stopRecording()` and
     * [stopRecording] are two different methods with the same name on two different classes. The
     * notification's Stop action calls the first and nothing calls the second, so the service ends
     * the track and this ViewModel never hears about it. [TrackRecordingUiState.isRecording] is
     * `activeTrack != null`, an in-memory field nothing repopulates from storage, so the record
     * button goes on claiming a recording that ended.
     *
     * **Why this is not routed through [stopRecording], which §2 asks to be justified.** It shares
     * [clearRecordingState] with it, so the state left behind is identical by construction rather
     * than by inspection. What it deliberately does **not** inherit is [stopRecording]'s end
     * waypoint, which is seeded from [lastGatedGpsFix] — the last GPS fix that cleared the gate, which by
     * the time this runs is where the walker was when they backgrounded the app, not where they
     * stopped recording. Writing a waypoint there would be a data write from a stale position onto
     * an already-ended track, which is the class of thing this whole change is about not doing.
     * A track stopped from the shade therefore still has no end waypoint; that is unchanged by
     * this, and recorded as a known gap rather than fixed here on a position nobody measured.
     *
     * **A read failure clears nothing** and is logged. "Could not read the row" is not evidence the
     * recording ended, and silently treating it as such would stop a live recording's UI on a
     * transient database error. That is the only branch [errorLog] carries, because it is the only

     * exception to report a state through it would misuse the abstraction rather than honour the
     * "never swallow a failure" rule it exists for.
     *
     * **A missing row clears, in the same branch as an ended one**, and that is a state rather than
     * an error: a track that no longer exists cannot still be recording, so there is no failure to
     * report. The two are folded together because the ViewModel's response to them is identical and
     * splitting them would imply a distinction the code does not make.
     *
     * Cheap, and a no-op when nothing is recording: it returns before touching storage unless
     * [TrackRecordingUiState.activeTrack] is set. A background-and-return **during** a live
     * recording reads one row, finds `endedAtEpochMillis` null, and changes nothing.

     * **It decides nothing.** Until dispatch 2026-09-28-400, Amendment 2, this method was also the
     * off-track decision: while returning, each call's distance joined a window here, the check
     * re-ran, and the alert was delivered from here. That is all [ReturnWatch]'s now, fed by the
     * recording service, so that it survives this ViewModel being cleared. The measurement stays
     * because the screen needs a distance whether or not anything is deciding on it (the planner's
     * ruling on question 1: the distance is not a copy of the watch's).
