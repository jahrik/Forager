/**
 * "Off track", redefined to fit the walker (dispatch 2026-09-28-425, plan task T21; the owner's
 * choices, 2026-10-03, and `RECORD.md` -402: the meaning of off track fits the user, not the
 * software). It replaces `DetectOffTrackUseCase`, which read three readings' distance to the start
 * rising by 25 m, so that walking back toward the start along the other side of a street, with a
 * network reading claiming 400 m accuracy among GPS readings at 4 m, alerted (the owner's walk:
 * five alerts, four false).
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * - **Measured against the path walked out** ([path]): the track as it stood when Return was
 *   tapped. Not the whole track, which keeps being recorded on the way back and would always read
 *   near zero. The distance is to the nearest point of the path's line, not to its nearest
 *   recorded point.
 * - **Only GPS readings count.** A network reading counts neither toward going off nor as being back
 *   on: it is skipped, and the verdict stays as it was. A live reading is told by the provider the
 *   platform reported ([next]'s `provider`, dispatch 2026-09-28-527), so an unknown provider is
 *   skipped too. A reading with no provider, a stored point in a replay of a saved walk, and the
 *   path itself, which is stored points, are told by the timestamp rule ([isNetworkProviderFix],
 *   the rule the tracks are read with). Its cost, measured on the owner's walk: 2 of 648 GPS
 *   readings carry sub-second stamps too, and are skipped with the network ones; on a live reading
 *   that no longer happens.
 * - **Off the path** is further from it than [OFF_TRACK_LINE_METERS] plus the reading's own
 *   reported accuracy, so a reading that says it is poor gets a wider line. No ceiling on that
 *   accuracy: the walk had no poor GPS reading (worst 9.9 m) to choose one from.
 * - **Going off** is off the path for at least [OFF_TRACK_HOLD_MILLIS], by at least
 *   [OFF_TRACK_MIN_READINGS] counting readings, with none back on the path in between (a reading
 *   back on restarts it). Then **one** alert.
 * - **Back on, and re-armed:** within the line for at least [OFF_TRACK_REARM_MILLIS]. Only then can
 *   it alert again, and only then does [OffTrackVerdict.isOffTrack] clear. A stray that lasts is not
 *   reminded of ("once per stray", the owner's choice; the 120 s repeat it replaces is gone).
 * - **An empty path decides nothing.**
 *
 * Every figure is provisional, named once above, and is for the owner's next walk to test.
 *
 * Time is the readings' own, not a clock: the judge is pure, and a replay of a stored walk runs it
 * as the phone did.
