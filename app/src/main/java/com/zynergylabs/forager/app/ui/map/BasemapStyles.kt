/**
 * The one place a [Basemap] becomes a MapLibre style — this project's own analog of the deleted
 * `BasemapTileSources.kt`, which did the same job for osmdroid's `ITileSource`.
 *
 * Every basemap here stays a **raster** source: the minimal MapLibre style JSON a raster tile
 * template needs (`"version": 8`, one `"raster"` source, one `"raster"` layer), built directly from
 * [Basemap]'s own fields rather than four separately hosted style documents — see [Basemap]'s class
 * doc for why. This is the same mechanism `MapLibreBasemapPreviewActivity`'s `rasterStyleJson`
 * proved (that scaffolding is deleted in this same change; its style-JSON shape survives here,
 * carried forward rather than reinvented).
 *
 * [glyphs] is set on every style, not only the ones that need text, because [SightingsMap] adds a
 * `SymbolLayer` with a `text-field` for the numbered foraging-area markers on top of *whichever*
 * basemap is active — a style with no `glyphs` URL renders `text-field` as nothing at all, silently
 * (this was hit for real: see `MapLibreBasemapPreviewActivity`'s history, "Fix missing area-marker
 * labels: style JSON had no glyphs URL", hardware-confirmed on PR #22). [AREA_MARKER_FONT_STACK] is
 * the same font that fix settled on, for the same reason: `"Open Sans Semibold"` is what
 * `demotiles.maplibre.org`'s own reference style actually ships in its glyph set, not a guess.

/**
 * Night mode's raster paint block: the **V1** transform, applied to the basemap layer.
 *
 *  - `raster-brightness-min 1` and `raster-brightness-max 0` swap the output range, so every
 *    channel comes out as `1 - c`: the pale ground goes dark and the dark linework goes pale.
 *  - `raster-hue-rotate 180` turns every hue half way round first, which undoes the half turn the
 *    inversion gives it. The net effect, per MapLibre Native's own raster shader at the pinned
 *    `13.5.0` (cited in `docs/audits/2026-09-27-marker-swatch-board.md` section 2), is
 *    `night = clamp(c + 1 - 2 * mean(r, g, b))` per gamma-encoded channel: lightness inverts, hue
 *    stays. [nightColorOf] is the same formula for colours this project sets itself.
 *
 * **Why V1 and not plain inversion (V2).** V2 is the same block without the hue rotate. It turns the
 * whole ground blue-violet, which the owner found an eyesore at night: "I like the V1 arrangement
 * better. The blue is pretty but that can be an eyesore at night". V1 keeps blue at about the day
 * map's share (the swatch board, section 1). On the S22 V1 held hue within 1 degree at P90 on
 * Topographical and Street (`docs/audits/2026-09-27-night-inversion-spike-and-tile-measurement.md`).
 *
 * **Why the earlier blocks were dropped.** This block used to dim the ground with
 * `raster-brightness-max` (removed 2026-08-26: it left the map brighter than the dark chrome around
 * it, and a lower cap had already failed on legibility), and then only desaturated it
 * (`raster-saturation -0.35`, `raster-contrast 0.1`), which left a day-bright ground. Both were
 * stopgaps for the inversion an earlier session believed needed tile interception, because the
 * raster paint properties have no per-pixel invert. The brightness-range swap is that invert.
 *
 * **Satellite stays day** (owner: "Satellite stays as it is at night"): [basemapTakesNightPaint]
 * is the one place that says so, and [styleJsonFor] reads it.
 *
 * All three are MapLibre style-spec v8 raster paint properties, so they need no code path of their
 * own; they ride in the style JSON the basemap swap already rebuilds.

/**
 * Where a night Topographical map's crossfade from Street to topo begins and ends. Below
 * [NIGHT_FADE_START_ZOOM] only Street is drawn; from it the topo layer fades in (`raster-opacity` 0 at the
 * start, 1 at [NIGHT_FADE_END_ZOOM]) over the Street layer, which is drawn, at opacity 1, until the end
 * (a layer's `maxzoom` is exclusive and its `minzoom` inclusive, style spec v8); from the end only topo.
 *
 * **Why 9.5 to 9.7 and not 9.4 to 9.6.** 9.5 is where OpenTopoMap's tiles change character: MapLibre Native
 * 13.5.0 fetches raster tile zoom `round(mapZoom + 1)` for a 256 px source (`util::coveringZoomLevel`, cited
 * on [rasterTileZoomFor]), so tile zoom 11 starts at map zoom 9.5, and V1's mean lightness is 0.42 to 0.47 on
 * OpenTopoMap tile zoom 7 to 10 and 0.23 to 0.32 on 11 to 15 (81-tile sample, completion report). A fade that
 * started at 9.4 would fade the tinted tile level 10 back in over 9.4 to 9.5. Measured pixelwise on the real
 * tiles of both sources at the same x/y, V1 on both: blended mean / median lightness 0.186 / 0.180 at 9.40
 * (topo opacity 0), 0.249 / 0.246 at 9.44, 0.296 / 0.290 at 9.47, **0.342 / 0.353 at 9.4999** (the edge of
 * "light", where the test's dark limit is 0.345), then **0.224 / 0.201 at 9.50**, the instant the tile level
 * becomes 11: a lightening and a snap back, the opposite of what the owner chose the switch for. Starting the
 * fade at 9.5 means only tile level 11 ever fades in, and the blend stays at mean 0.22 to 0.27 (test). The
 * topo layer's `minzoom` is pinned to tile level 11 or deeper by `TopoNightStreetSwitchTest`.

 * The basemap a night [basemap] shows below [NIGHT_FADE_START_ZOOM] (and under its own layer until [NIGHT_FADE_END_ZOOM]), or `null` when it shows itself at
 * every zoom. Only Topographical has one: [Basemap.OSM_STANDARD]. A per-basemap decision rather than an
 * inline `if`, like [basemapTakesNightPaint], so the style and the attribution caption read the same
 * answer and a test can pin the set.
 *
 * **Why.** The owner, on the S22, with three screenshots: "When maps are in topo night mode, they are in
 * night mode when zoomed in, but after zooming out to a certain point, it goes back to day mode. I
 * checked the diff between night and day and they have light colors, just a different palette". Night was
 * never switching off: [NIGHT_RASTER_PAINT] has no zoom dependence. OpenTopoMap's own low-zoom tiles
 * (tile zoom 7 to 10) are tinted, green lowlands and tan hills, and V1, which flips lightness about each
 * pixel's channel mean, turns the saturated greens light (the zoomed-out night screenshot's dominant
 * (120,216,120) is V1 of the day screenshot's (72,168,72), which gives (119,215,119); both quantised to
 * 16 levels). At trail zoom its tiles are pale and V1 makes them dark.
 *
 * **Every alternative, and why it lost.** The owner's test for the choice: "it does look a lot better than
 * switching to day mode suddenly. We have two tradeoffs and only one can break confidence in the app." A
 * visible change of map style that stays night is a tradeoff; a map that turns light below a zoom reads as
 * night mode failing, which is the one that breaks confidence.
 *  1. *Half-amplitude V1 below 9.5* (`raster-brightness-min` 0.5; the planner's ruling, built, then run on
 *     the S22). Owner: "Coder took the dimming route anyway. The map needs to not be dimmed, but match what
 *     we see when zoomed in". It dimmed the map, as the August 2026 dimming attempts above did.
 *  2. *Dimming with no inversion*, rejected before it was built: "Option A. No dimming. That's tacky and not
 *     a true night mode option".
 *  3. *Anything per pixel* (contrast, saturation, scaled brightness): "Pure inverted colors is the way, not
 *     fine tuned pixel manipulation. We may need to lose some of the topo rendering to make that happen". The
 *     shader keeps each pixel's channel mean through the hue rotate, so the output's channel mean is an
 *     affine function of the input's whatever the paint: no raster paint can make the low-zoom tinted tiles
 *     look like the pale zoomed-in ones.
 *  4. *Deeper OpenTopoMap tiles* (a second source with a smaller `tileSize`): the tinted look belongs to
 *     tile levels 7 to 10 however they are fetched, so reaching level 11 at map zoom 7 needs `tileSize` 32,
 *     where labels are about 1 dp and each view is about 34 times the tiles, from a server that publishes no
 *     limit and asks "bigger projects" to get in touch.
 *  5. *A hillshade layer over Street (Terrarium DEM)*: adds only subtle relief, does not keep hues, does not
 *     help above 9.5, and needs a licence credit block (a composite of public-domain and CC BY sources) and
 *     its own tiles, offline included.
 *  6. *A minimum zoom of 9.5 for topo*: pure V1, but it stops topo zooming out past about 31 by 68 km on a
 *     phone, and the app's own opening zoom for a region over 30 km is 9.0.
 *  7. *A hard switch at 9.5* (built, then superseded by the crossfade the owner asked for: "Add the cross
 *     fade to the topo switch. I honestly considered that myself").
 *  8. *A fade over 9.4 to 9.6*, rejected by measurement (table on [NIGHT_FADE_START_ZOOM]).
 *
 * **What the owner chose**, shown the renders: "I notice street maps doesn't have this problem. Maybe
 * switch to street maps instead of topo maps when zoomed out? Only when night maps mode is on. With it
 * off no switch to street occurs." So at topo night, below 9.5, the layer is OSM Standard, which V1 turns
 * dark at every zoom (mean 0.15 to 0.23 on tile zoom 7 to 15, one to four tiles each), with the same
 * [NIGHT_RASTER_PAINT] on both layers, unchanged, and the topo layer fading in over 9.5 to 9.7. Topo day,
 * every other basemap, Satellite and the offline style are untouched.
