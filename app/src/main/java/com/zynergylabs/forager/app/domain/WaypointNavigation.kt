/*
 * Navigating to a chosen waypoint (dispatch 2026-09-28-502, plan tasks T8 and T9). The step path the
 * owner confirmed, with Amendment 1 (RECORD.md -503):
 * 1. Tap a waypoint, then "Navigate" in its bubble, its details sheet, or Records; with or without a
 *    recording.
 * 2. The navigation view starts as for a return; the HUD points at the waypoint with its straight-line
 *    distance; the navigation control shows the X in a circle, "Stop navigating".
 * 3. A straight dashed line from the walker to the waypoint.
 * 4. Arrival as at the start: the ring with a check and "Arrived"; navigation stays on until ended.
 * 5. Back or the X-circle ends it. Back goes back to where Navigate was tapped.
 * 6. A return under way is overruled while this is active, and picks up again when it ends.
 * 7. The off-track alert and the walked-path line belong to the return; neither runs meanwhile.
 * "Pick navigation back up": the chosen waypoint survives the app being closed by the phone.
