/**
 * A Cartography entry's curation-and-writing surface — Journal Stage 2b, extended by its own
 * follow-up dispatch (point 2). [candidates]/[candidateOfflineRegions] are that day's *live* trip
 * report, reloaded on every open (creation or reopen); [entryContentsOf] merges them against the
 * entry's own persisted decisions into three states per candidate — **included** (kept), **left out**
 * (withheld), or **new** (not yet decided) — and [EntryContentsPanel] shows them (data part A, dispatch
 * 2026-09-28-667, which replaced the one-card-per-item Withhold list). A `null` [candidates] means the
 * trip report hasn't finished loading yet (or failed); the panel then shows the entry's own
 * already-decided items only, so the screen still renders sensibly rather than going blank.
 *
 * **No field here is required, and nothing here reads as incomplete for being empty** —
 * `amendment-2b-optional-writing.md`: selection alone is a complete act of authorship, prose is one
 * optional component. The writing field's own placeholder says "optional" rather than prompting
 * completion, and [onFinish] (shown only while [CartographyEntry.isDraft]) never gates on [entry.text]
 * or any decided-item count.
 *
 * ## Save/Discard/Cancel for a committed entry (device-check patch, Item 1)
 *
 * A **draft** still autosaves silently on every change — [onFinish] ("Finish entry") is its only
 * button, and [onBack] still just closes the form with no prompt, unchanged from before this
 * dispatch. A **committed** entry ([CartographyEntry.isDraft] `false`) is different: changes are
 * explicit now, tracked by [hasUnsavedChanges]. This screen shows a Save button for one (mirroring
 * where "Finish entry" sits for a draft — the two are mutually exclusive since a single entry is
 * never both), calling [onSave], which persists in place without leaving. Tapping back
 * ([onBack]'s icon) while [hasUnsavedChanges] instead asks — Save / Discard / Cancel — rather than
 * silently discarding the way a draft's own close does; Cancel dismisses the prompt and stays right
 * here, Save calls [onSave] then leaves, Discard calls [onDiscardChanges] (which reloads the entry
 * from the database and leaves in one step — see that callback's own doc comment for why it's not
 * an in-memory revert). Backgrounding a committed entry with unsaved changes is deliberately **not**
 * handled here: there is no window to show this prompt in at that moment, so `AvailabilityScreen`
 * saves silently on its own lifecycle hook instead — see that file's own doc comment on why that's
 * not a reason to discard on, say, a phone call.
 *
 * ## The leave prompt is hoisted, not local (back-nav-and-save-flow dispatch, Items 1/2)
 *
 * [showLeavePrompt]/[onRequestBack]/[onDismissLeavePrompt] used to be this composable's own local
 * `confirmingLeave` state and a private `requestBack()` wrapper around [onBack], reachable only by
 * the arrow below. System back was routed entirely around it — [CartographyScreen] had no
 * `BackHandler` at all reaching this deep, so back exited the whole Journal in one step and this
 * dialog never fired regardless of [hasUnsavedChanges]. [CartographyScreen] now owns the same
 * decision (its own `requestLeaveEntry()`) so its `BackHandler` and this screen's own arrow drive
 * the identical prompt through the identical path — see that composable's own doc comment. [onBack]
 * itself stays the raw, unconditional close: both the leave prompt's own Save option and the
 * persistent Save button's own confirmation (below) call `onSave()` then `onBack()` directly, since
 * a just-saved entry has nothing left to ask about.
 *
 * ## Three prompts, three separate triggers (pending-edit-and-fixes dispatch, Items 1/3)
 *
 * `confirmingSave` (Item 3): the persistent Save button no longer saves directly — it opens this
 * local confirmation first, since "save confirms, then exits" (the prior dispatch's own change)
 * otherwise had no confirmation at all. [showLeavePrompt] and [showReturnPrompt] are each already
 * their own confirmation for their own trigger, so neither routes through `confirmingSave` — all
 * three are mutually exclusive, reached only by their own specific path (the arrow/system back, a
 * tap on Save, or resuming from the background), never stacked.
