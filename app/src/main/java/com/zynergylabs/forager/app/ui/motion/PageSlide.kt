/*
 * Motion Part 3, item 1 (dispatch 2026-09-28-676; the owner, RECORD -651: Journal pages "Slide in, slide back (Recommended)":
 * "Opened pages slide in from the right; Back slides them out to the right"). A page you open slides in from the right over the
 * one beneath, which stays where it is; going back, the page slides out to the right and uncovers the one beneath, retracing the
 * way in (CLAUDE.md memory: "Back retraces the way in").
 *
 * **What a leaving page does.** From its first leaving frame, a page that is going (the one being covered on the way in, the one
 * sliding out on the way back) takes no touch ([leavingTakesNoTouches], Part 1), is gone from the semantics tree but for its
 * leaving marker (Part 2's fix (a): a screen reader finds the arriving page alone), and its Back handlers are off (Part 2,
 * Amendment 1, item 5), so a Back pressed mid-slide is the arriving page's. These are the same three things [TabCrossfade] does to
 * a leaving tab, from the same pieces.
 *
 * **The arriving page takes touches where it is drawn.** The slide moves the page by placement, not by drawing alone, because two
 * Journal pages host a live map (the entry report and the find's location picker), and a hosted `View` follows placement, not a
 * drawn offset (see [holdWhileLeaving]). So for the length of a slide-in, the arriving page's controls are where they are drawn,
 * on their way to where they settle. Their settled touch areas are unchanged. This is the one place this part moves a touch area
 * while it moves, and it is reported as a stop for the owner rather than decided here.
 *
 * **The covered page is held by a fade that stays at full until the slide is done** ([pageCoverHold]). The first build showed
 * that with [ExitTransition.None] AnimatedContent drops it at once.

/**
 * One page at a time, sliding to the next when [targetState] changes, on [MotionTokens.pageSlideSpec]. Deeper pages
 * ([depthOf] larger) are further in: going to a page at least as deep as the current one slides it in from the right over the
 * current one; going to a shallower one slides the current page out to the right, uncovering it. Pages with the same [contentKey]
 * are one page: a change between them updates it in place, with no slide (an open find whose fields change, for instance).
 *
 * [content] must draw from the page it is handed, never from the caller's current state: while two pages are on screen the leaving
 * one is drawn from its own value. That is why a page carries what it shows (the open entry, say), so a report sliding out after
 * its entry has closed can still be drawn.
 *
 * Every page is drawn on [pageColor], opaque, so the page sliding in covers the one beneath rather than showing it through
 * (the pages themselves draw no background; the screen behind them did, before two of them shared it). The default is what the
 * app's Scaffold draws behind its content. Not for a surface over the map: an opaque page there would break the map chrome's 80%
 * rule, which is why the Tools drawer's pages do not slide (motion Part 3, Amendment 1's stops).
 *
 * Clipped to its own bounds, so a page sliding in from the right is not drawn over whatever sits beside the Journal (the landscape
 * rail). Under reduced motion ([LocalReduceMotion]) a page changes at once and no leaving page is kept (docs/motion-spec.md §4).
