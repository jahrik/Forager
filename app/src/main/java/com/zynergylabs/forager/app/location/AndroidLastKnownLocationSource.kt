/**
 * [LastKnownLocationSource] over the platform's [LocationManager], no Play services — dispatch
 * 2026-09-28-510, the report's item 4. Asks each provider for the position it still holds
 * ([LocationManager.getLastKnownLocation], API 1) and returns the newest by its own fix time, the same
 * clock [LocationFix.Update.timestampEpochMillis] carries everywhere else, so its age reads the same way.
 *
 * The passive provider is asked too: it holds the newest fix any app on the phone received, which is
 * often newer than the GPS or network provider's own when this app has not been running.
