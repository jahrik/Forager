/**
 * Intent 2026-09-28-274, Step 2. The owner's rule, verbatim: "Fold only if members change". An open fan stays open
 * through map changes that don't touch its members. If a member disappears, the fan re-fans the survivors, or closes
 * if fewer than 2 remain. A layer switch that hides the fan's layer still closes it, because its members disappear.
 *
 * Why it exists: the device log (c-step1-h4-excerpt.txt) showed the reopen after a delete succeeding
 * (`openFanFor` 7 of 7) and a content effect folding it 10 s later, because every content change folded, whether or
 * not a member was in it. Each case goes through the entry point the map's effect calls: [MapTapHandler.onContentChanged]
 * for the handler, and [FanReopenCoordinator.onContentEffect] for the return path.
 *
 * "Present" is the member's key in the content the map now draws ([MapProbe.markersOf]) on a layer that is switched on.
