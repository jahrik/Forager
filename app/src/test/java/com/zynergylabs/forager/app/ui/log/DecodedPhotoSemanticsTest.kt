/**
 * Dispatch 2026-09-28-317, planner ruling on the semantics stop: the gesture fix must leave what a
 * screen reader reads on the four affected photos **unchanged**, loaded and not yet loaded.
 *
 * For each site and each state this dumps everything the merged node carries (role,
 * contentDescription, click and long-click actions with their labels, custom actions, and every other
 * semantics property, sorted by name) plus the same node in the unmerged tree and its unmerged
 * children, and asserts it equals a recorded dump. The recorded dumps in [GOLDEN] were captured on
 * the **unfixed** build (`DecodedPhoto` as a `Box` until loaded, then an `Image`), and this class is
 * expected to pass identically before and after the fix: that is the claim under test, and so it is
 * the one place in this change where "passes before and after" is the point, not a warning. It bites
 * when a change makes the not-yet-loaded node expose a description or role the placeholder never
 * had, or drops the role or description once loaded.
 *
 * The "not yet loaded" state is held by [GatedDecode], so the placeholder is on screen for certain;
 * the state is asserted by the absence of any "Log photo" node before the dump is taken.
