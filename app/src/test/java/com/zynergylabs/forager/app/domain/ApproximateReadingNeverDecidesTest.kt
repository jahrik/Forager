/**
 * Dispatch 2026-09-28-510, the owner's rule 3 (RECORD -508): "an approximate reading never enters a
 * track, the off-track alert or 'Arrived'". "Arrived" is `AvailabilityScreenApproximatePositionTest`'s.
 * These two follow the reading the S22 gave indoors, a network fix of about 100 m, down the paths
 * recording and the return take, which this dispatch does not touch and which never read the screen's
 * state: so they pass before this dispatch as after it, and guard against a later change feeding the
 * screen's approximate reading into them. Each carries its own control, so it is seen able to fail.
 *
 * Not covered, because it is not true today and is outside this dispatch (the report's findings): a
 * **GPS** reading worse than 50 m is kept in a Battery saver track (ceiling 100 m) and counts for the
 * off-track judge, its line widened by its own accuracy.
