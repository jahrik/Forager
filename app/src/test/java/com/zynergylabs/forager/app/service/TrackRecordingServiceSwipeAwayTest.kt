/**
 * The real [TrackRecordingService] and the real [AppContainer], around the moment the app is
 * swiped away from recents (dispatch 2026-09-28-400; Part 1 pinned the fault here, Amendment 2
 * moved the off-track decision into `ReturnWatch`, which this service begins, feeds and ends).
 *
 * The first two tests are the fixed behaviour: **the off-track alert is delivered with no
 * ViewModel in existence,** through the service's own `onStartCommand`, read as the notification
 * the real `AndroidAlertDelivery` posts. The container's delivery cannot be swapped for a fake, so
 * the notification is the reading.
 *
 * **The reopened screen (Amendment 3, Part 3a).** Part 2 left two tests here pinning a fault. They
 * are replaced: a ViewModel built while the service records takes the recording up, Stop on it
 * ends the recording, and Record on it cannot start a second one.
 *
 * ## What is real here, and the three steps that are not
 *
 * Real: the ViewModel's own callbacks, the service through its own `onStartCommand`, the tracker
 * over Robolectric's `LocationManager`, the Room database and the watch behind [AppContainer], and
 * the alert delivery.
 *
 * Not reached, and said plainly:
 * 1. **The swipe from recents.** It is stood in for by `ViewModelStore.clear()` with the service
 *    left running. On the S22 the real swipe was checked on 2026-10-02 (the report's "Phone
 *    check"): the process, the service and its notification survived.
 * 2. **`MainActivity`'s `LaunchedEffect(trackUiState.activeTrack)`,** which is what turns a new
 *    `activeTrack` into `ACTION_START` and a cleared one into `ACTION_STOP`. No test in this
 *    repository composes `MainActivity`. [startIntent] and [stopIntent] are built here from the
 *    same three constants that effect uses, as `TrackRecordingServiceTest.startIntent` does.
 * 3. **The process being killed.** Only the null intent a sticky restart delivers is reachable.
 *
 * ## Ending what was started
 *
 * `TrackRecordingServiceTest`'s header records what an unstopped recording does to the next test
 * class's sandbox. Every test here that starts the service stops it through `ACTION_STOP` inside
 * its own body, waits for the stop to finish, destroys the controller and drains, in a `finally`.
 * Every ViewModel is stopped there too, which is `CLAUDE.md`'s poll-loop rule applied here.
