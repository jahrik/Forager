/**
 * Dispatch 2026-09-28-400, Amendment 3, Part 3b, with the real application, container and
 * database. The owner's path 1, "A": a track nothing is recording any more becomes a normal
 * finished track, ended at its last recorded point.
 *
 * ## What launches the sweep, and why this class changed
 *
 * It was first launched from `ForagerApplication.onCreate`, and these tests drove `onCreate`. That
 * made the app's database open at every app start, which nothing had done before, and an existing
 * test that replaces the database file (`ForagerDatabaseDestructiveFallbackTest`) then failed in 7
 * runs of 10. The planner's second ruling moved the launch: **once per process, when the first
 * recording ViewModel is created.** `onCreate` only notes the process's start time. So here the
 * rows are written, `onCreate` is shown to end nothing, and then a ViewModel is built from the
 * container the way `MainActivity`'s factory builds it.
 *
 * An earlier version of these tests dated rows an hour back while `onCreate` still swept. The
 * first app start's own sweep could then reach them before the start under test did, and a revert
 * check failed for a reason that was not its edit. That is how the interference was first seen.
