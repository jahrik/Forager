/**
 * The screen's ViewModel and [ReturnWatch] together, on a plain JVM, around the moment the app is
 * swiped away from recents (dispatch 2026-09-28-400; Part 1 pinned the fault here, Amendment 2
 * moved the off-track decision out of the ViewModel).
 *
 * **What moved.** The decision, the returning flag, the rolling window and the cooldown are
 * [ReturnWatch]'s, held by the app's container and driven by the recording service. The ViewModel
 * calls it for Return and copies its state. So when the Activity is destroyed and this ViewModel
 * is cleared, the decision is still there, and it still delivers as long as something feeds it.
 *
 * **Who stands in for the service here.** No service runs on a plain JVM. [serviceBegins] and the
 * watch half of [fixArrives] are the three calls `TrackRecordingService` makes (begin, every raw
 * fix, end), made by hand. The real service making them is
 * `TrackRecordingServiceSwipeAwayTest`. A real fix reaches two listeners, the service's and the
 * ViewModel's own, so [fixArrives] sends each fix both ways.
 *
 * **What stands in for the swipe-away:** `ViewModelStore.clear()`, as in Part 1. On the S22 the
 * real swipe was checked on 2026-10-02 (the report's "Phone check").
 *
 * ## The reopened screen (Amendment 3, Part 3a)
 *
 * Part 2 left two tests here pinning a fault: a ViewModel built after the swipe did not know a
 * recording was running, and pressing Record made a second track. They are replaced by the tests
 * of the fixed behaviour. A ViewModel built while the watch is begun **takes the recording up**:
 * it shows it as running, with its breadcrumbs, its start marker and the return that was under
 * way. The begun watch is what it goes by, never an open track row, because a killed process
 * leaves the same row.
 *
 * ## The poll loop
 *
 * `beginPolling` is an unbounded `delay` loop while recording (`CLAUDE.md`, "A stalled test run in
 * this repo is an unstopped poll loop"). [runRecordingTest] stops every ViewModel this class
 * built, in a `finally`, inside the test body. Only `runCurrent` and `advanceTimeBy`, never
 * `advanceUntilIdle`, once a recording has started.
