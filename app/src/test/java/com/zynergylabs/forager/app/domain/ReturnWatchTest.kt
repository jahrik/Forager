/**
 * [ReturnWatch] on a plain JVM: no Activity, no Service, no Compose tree, no coroutine.
 *
 * ## Dispatch 2026-09-28-425 changed the rule these tests drive
 *
 * Off track was three readings' distance to the start rising by 25 m, with a 120 s repeat. It is
 * now [OffTrackJudge]'s: further from the path walked out than 40 m plus the reading's accuracy,
 * for 15 s and at least three readings, once per stray. The tests that walked away three readings a
 * second apart now walk away over 15 s ([walkAway]); the cooldown's tests are replaced by "once per
 * stray"; and the side-by-side test now holds the watch to a bare [OffTrackJudge] instead of the
 * retired `DetectOffTrackUseCase`. What each asserted before and after is listed in
 * `docs/navigation/2026-10-03-off-track-rule-report.md`.
 *
 * The path a return is measured against is the start, then the points the service kept before
 * Return ([ReturnWatch.onKeptPoint]). A test that gives no kept points measures from the start alone.
