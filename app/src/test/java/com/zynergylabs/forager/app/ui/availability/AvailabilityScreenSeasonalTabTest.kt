 * The Seasonal tab's honesty requirement, checked as real on-screen text: sample size, the
 * "estimate ... not a guarantee" framing, the observations-with-no-preceding-event count, and the
 * observer-effort caveat must actually be displayed, not merely present somewhere in the
 * [FruitingLagDistribution] this tab renders. Same "real screen under Robolectric" style as
 * [AvailabilityScreenLayoutTest]; the chart canvas itself is not asserted on here — Robolectric
 * does not render Compose `Canvas` content meaningfully, the same limitation that file's own doc
 * comment records for the map.
