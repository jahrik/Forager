/**
 * Dispatch 2026-09-28-685, fix 3 (the owner, RECORD -678: "Fix: record it as skipped (Recommended)").
 * On the 2026-10-07 S22 walk the phone was on silent, Android dropped all four off-track buzzes
 * (`ignored_for_ringer_mode`), and the Return record said `vibration=done` for each. Now it says
 * `vibration=skipped(phone on silent)`, and the alert's behaviour is unchanged: the vibration is still
 * issued, with the same override (none, for off-track: the owner's 2026-09-11 ruling).
 *
 * Through the real entry point: [ReturnWatch.onFix] walking off track, delivering through the real
 * [AndroidAlertDelivery] into the real [FileReturnRecord], read back as the line it wrote. The ringer
 * is faked behind [AlertAudibility], the seam the trip-start warning already reads; the vibration
 * and the notification are the delivery's own seams, recorded.
