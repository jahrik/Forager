/**
 * Invariants of the basemap catalogue itself, headless on the JVM — no Android, no osmdroid.
 *
 * These deliberately do not restate the table in [Basemap]. Asserting `USGS_TOPO.maxZoom == 15`
 * would only prove the file can be read back, and CLAUDE.md calls a check that cannot fail on a
 * real change what it is. What is asserted here is the set of properties the *feature* depends on
 * and that a plausible future edit could break: that the app is still usable outside the United
 * States, that every option can be told apart in the menu, that no option is shipped without the
 * credit text the UI relies on, and that no US-only service has crept back in.
 *
 * The claims that need the real osmdroid artifact — names, zoom ceilings, URL shape, copyright
 * strings, cache separation — are in `BasemapTileSourceTest`. The claim that a live swap preserves
 * the map's overlays is in `SightingsMapBasemapSwapTest`.

     * would be clamped to below its own opening zoom the moment it was selected for a small search
     * — the map would silently refuse to open where the code says it opens. Duplicated as a literal
     * rather than imported because `zoomForRadiusKm` lives in a Compose/osmdroid file that a plain
     * JVM test should not be loading; the coupling is stated here so a change to either end has a
     * reason to look at the other.
